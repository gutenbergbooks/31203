<div class="initial" style="clear: both">

<p class="dropcapsection">T is a natural, nor can it
be deemed an illaudable
curiosity to be desirous of
being informed of whatever
relates to those who have eminently
distinguished themselves for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4_1" id="Page_4_1">[4]</a></span>
sagacity, parts, learning, or what
else may have exalted their characters,
and thereby entitled them to a
degree of respect superior to the rest
of their cotemporaries. The transmission
of such particulars, has ever
been thought no more than discharging
a debt due to posterity; wherefore
it is hoped, that what is here
intended to be offered to the publick,
relative to a gentleman, who is
universally allowed to have merited
so largely in the republic of letters,
and more particularly in his own
profession, a profession, not less useful
than respectable, will not be
judged impertinent or disagreeable.</p>

<p>Our learned author was descended
from a distinguished family in Buckinghamshire,
and born at Stepney the
second of August 1673. His father,
Mr. Matthew Mead, was held in great
esteem as a divine among the presbyterians,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5_1" id="Page_5_1">[5]</a></span>
and was possessed, during
their usurped power, of the living of
Stepney; from whence he was ejected
the second year after the restoration
of king Charles the IId. Nevertheless,
tho&#8217; he had fifteen children,
of whom our Richard was the
seventh, he found means, with a
moderate fortune, to give them a
compleat education. To this purpose
he kept a tutor in his house
to instruct them, and they were
taught latin rather by practice than
by rules.</p>

<p>Party-rage perhaps never run higher
than about the latter end of Charles
the IId&#8217;s reign; hereby this little domestic
academy was dispersed in
1683. The king, or rather his ministers,
were determined to be revenged
on those, whom they could
not prevail on to concur with their
measures. Mr. Mead (the father) was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6_1" id="Page_6_1">[6]</a></span>
accused of being concerned in some
designs against the court; wherefore
being conscious that even his being a
presbyterian, rendered him obnoxious
to those in power, he chose rather to
consult his security by a retreat, then
to rely upon his innocence; to this
purpose he sought and found that repose
in Holland, which was denied
him in his own country; having
first placed his son Richard at a
school, under the tuition of an able
master of his own principles: under
whose care our young gentleman,
by a ready genius, strong memory,
and close application, made a great
proficiency. At seventeen years of
age he was sent to Utrecht, to be
further instructed in liberal knowledge,
by the celebrated Gr&aelig;vius,
with whom he continued three
years.</p>

<p>Having determined to devote his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7_1" id="Page_7_1">[7]</a></span>
attention to medicine, he removed
from Utrecht to Leyden, where he
attended Dr. Herman&#8217;s botanical
lectures, and was initiated into the
theory and practice of physick, by
the truely eminent Dr. Pitcairn, who
then held the professorial chair of
this science in that university: here
our young student&#8217;s assiduity and
discernment, so effectually recommended
him to the professor, who
was not very communicative of his
instructions out of the college, that
he established a lasting correspondence
with him, and received several
observations from him, which he
inserted in one of his subsequent
productions.</p>

<p>His academical studies being finished,
Mr. Mead sought further
accomplishments in Italy, whither
he was accompanied by his elder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8_1" id="Page_8_1">[8]</a></span>
brother,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Mr. Polhill, and Dr. Thomas
Pellet, afterwards president of
the college of physicians.</p>

<p>In the course of this tour, Mr.
Mead commenced doctor in philosophy
and medicine at Padua, the
twenty-sixth of August 1695, and
afterwards spent some time at Naples
and Rome: how advantageous to
himself, as well as how useful to
mankind he rendered his travels, his
works bear ample testimony.</p>

<p>About the middle of the year
1696, he returned home, and settled
at Stepney, in the neighbourhood
where he was born: the success,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9_1" id="Page_9_1">[9]</a></span>he met with in his practice here,
established his reputation, and was a
happy presage of his future fortunes.
If it be remembered, that our author
was, when he began to practise,
no more than twenty-three
years old, that only three years, including
the time taken up in his
travels, were appropriated to his medical
attainments, it may be, not unreasonably,
admitted, that nothing
but very uncommon talents, join&#8217;d
to an extraordinary assiduity, could
have enabled him to distinguish himself,
at this early a period of life,
in so extensive, and so important a
science.</p>

<p>In 1702, Dr. Mead exhibited to
the public, a manifest evidence of
his capacity for, as well as application
to medical researches, in his <i>mechanical
account of poisons</i>; which
he informs us was begun some years<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10_1" id="Page_10_1">[10]</a></span>
before he had leisure to publish it.
These subjects, our author justly observes,
had been treated hitherto very
obscurely, to place therefore the
surprizing ph&#339;nomena, arising from
these active bodies in a more intelligible
light, was his professed intention;
how well he succeeded, the
reception this piece universally met
with, even from its first publication,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
sufficiently declares. In 1708
he gave a new edition of it, with
some few additions, the principal of
which consists in some strictures on
the external use of mercury in raising
salivations. He has considerably
further explained his sentiments upon
the same head, in the edition of this
work printed in 1747.</p>

<p>This last edition has received so
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11_1" id="Page_11_1">[11]</a></span>many additions and alterations, as
might almost entitle it to the character
of a new performance.&mdash;&mdash;A
stiffness of opinion has been but too
commonly observed, especially among
writers on science; and age has been
seldom found to have worn out this
pertinacity: a favourite hypothesis
has been defended even in opposition
to the most obvious experiments,
with a degree of obstinacy ever incompatible
with the real interests of
truth. On the contrary, our ingenious
author has set before his literary
successors, an example of sagacity
and fortitude, truely worthy of
imitation, in the victory he obtained
over these self-sufficient pre-possessions;
length of years was so far
from rivetting in him an inflexibility
of sentiment, that, joined to a most
extended experience, it served only
to teach him, that he had been mistaken:
his candid retraction of what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12_1" id="Page_12_1">[12]</a></span>
he thought to have been advanced
amiss by himself, cannot be better
expressed than in his own words.
&#8220;Neither have I, says he,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> been
ashamed on some occasions, (as
the Latins said) <i>c&aelig;dere vineta
mea</i>, to retrench or alter whatever
I judged to be wrong. <i>Dies diem
docet.</i> I think truth never comes
so well recommended, as from
one who owns his error: and it is
allowed that our first master never
shewed more wisdom and greatness
of mind, then in confessing his
mistake, in taking a fracture of a
skull, for the natural suture;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and
the compliment, which Celsus<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a>
makes to him on this occasion, is
very remarkable and just;&#8221; nor is
it less applicable to Dr. Mead at present
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13_1" id="Page_13_1">[13]</a></span>than it was to the Coan sage
in his day. &#8220;<i>More scilicet</i>, inquit,
<i>magnorum virorum, &amp; fiduciam
magnarum rerum habentium. Nam
levia ingenia, quia nihil habent,
nihil sibi detrahunt: magno ingenio,
multaque nihilominus habituro,
convenit etiam simplex veri erroris
confessio; pr&aelig;cipueque in eo ministerio,
quod utilitatis caus&acirc; posteris
traditur.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The insertion of additions and improvements
in the title of new editions
of books, has been too generally,
though sometimes justly, understood
as little else than a contrivance
of the bookseller, to animate a
languishing sale; but this is far from
being the case in respect to the works
of our author, whose maturer sentiments
on many of the subjects, he
had before treated of, cannot be
well comprehended, unless by a careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14_1" id="Page_14_1">[14]</a></span>
perusal of his later corrections,
seeing the alterations he has thought
fit thereby to make in his earlier
productions, are not less necessary to
be attended to by the prudent practitioner,
than they are really interesting
to the unhappy patient: the
truth of which cannot be more manifestly
evinced, than by his last
publication of his essays on poisons;
wherein he entirely subverts his former
hypothesis, and builds his reasonings
upon a new foundation; he
also tacitly admits his former experiments
to have been too precipitately
made, and the conclusions deduced
from them, to have been too
hastily drawn.</p>

<p>To illustrate what has been advanced
upon this head, it will not
be improper to observe, that when
Dr. Mead first wrote these essays, he
was of opinion, &#8220;That the effect of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15_1" id="Page_15_1">[15]</a></span>
poisons, especially those of venemous
animals, might be accounted
for, by their affecting the blood
only: but the consideration of the
suddenness of their mischief, too
quick to be brought about in the
course of the circulation, (for the
bite of a rattle snake killed a dog
in less than a quarter of an hour)<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
together with the nature of the
symptoms entirely nervous, induced
him to change his sentiments,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>&#8221;
and to conclude, that
the poison must be conveyed by a
medium of much greater quickness,
which could be no other than the animal
spirits.</p>

<p>From hence our author is led to
prefix to the last edition of this performance,
an inquiry into the existence
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16_1" id="Page_16_1">[16]</a></span>and nature of this imperceptible
fluid, with which we have been but
very imperfectly acquainted. He has
also added several new experiments,
tending to confirm this theory, and
explain the properties of the viperine
venom, particularly by venturing to
<i>taste</i> it; at the same time he has
likewise contradicted some of those
he had formerly made, whereby he
had been induced to believe, this
poison partook of a degree of acidity:
for instance, he formerly asserted
that he had seen this sanies,
&#8220;as an acid, turn the blue tincture
of <i>heliotropium</i>, to a red colour;<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>&#8221;
whereas his more modern trials convinced
him, it produced no alteration
at all.</p>

<p>The essays on the <i>tarantula</i> and
<i>mad dog</i>, are likewise considerably
enlarged in the last impression; especially
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17_1" id="Page_17_1">[17]</a></span>the latter, in which is now
comprehended a regular and elegant
history of the symptoms attending
the bite of this enraged animal, the
reason of the consequent <i>hydrophobia</i>,
and more extensive directions for the
cure: also an accurate description of
the <i>lichen cinereus terrestris</i>, its efficacy,
and manner of acting. A
composition of equal parts of this
plant and black pepper, was inserted,
at our author&#8217;s desire, into the London
dispensatory, in the year 1721,
under the title of <i>pulvis antilyssus</i>,
which he afterwards altered by using
two parts of the former, and only
one of the latter, as it now stands:
in 1735 he also recommended the
use of this medicine in a loose sheet,
intitled, <i>a certain cure for the bite of
a mad dog</i>.</p>

<p>In treating of poisonous minerals,
exclusive of what is added concerning<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18_1" id="Page_18_1">[18]</a></span>
mercurial unctions, our author
has given a new analysis of the antient
and modern <i>arsenic</i>; and his
essay on deliterious plants, has afforded
him an opportunity of enquiring
into the <i>cicuta</i>, so much in
use of old for killing, especially at
Athens, and which is said to have
been administered to <i>Socrates</i> in consequence
of his condemnation. To
this he has likewise subjoin&#8217;d an appendix,
concerning the mischievous
effects of the simple water distilled
from the <i>lauro-cerasus</i>, or common
laurel, which were first observed
some years since in <i>Ireland</i>, where,
for the sake of its flavour, it was
frequently mixed with brandy.&mdash;His
observations upon venemous exhalations,
are not less extended, nor
ought the, as well useful as ornamental,
plates added to this last edition,
to pass unnoticed, particularly,
&#8220;The anatomical description of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19_1" id="Page_19_1">[19]</a></span>
parts in a viper, and in a rattlesnake,
which are concerned in
their poison,&#8221; by our great anatomist
the learned and ingenious Dr.
Nichols.</p>

<p>In 1703 Dr. <i>Mead</i> communicated
to the royal society, a letter published
in Italy in 1687 (a copy of
which he met with in the course
of his travels) from Dr. Bonomo to
Seignor Redi, containing some observations
concerning the worms of
human bodies;<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> whereby it is intended
to prove, that the disease, we
call the itch, proceeds merely from
the biting of these animalcules: this
opinion is espoused by our author
in one of his latest performances,<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
wherein therefore he directs only <i>topical</i>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20_1" id="Page_20_1">[20]</a></span>applications for the cure of this
troublesome disease.</p>

<p>The proofs our young physician
had already given of literary merit,
recommended him soon after the
above-mentioned communication, to
a seat among that learned body; in
the same year he was also elected
one of the physicians of St. Thomas&#8217;s
hospital, and was employed by the
surgeons company to read anatomical
lectures at their hall, which he
continued to do for some years.</p>

<p>In 1704 appeared his treatise <i>de
imperio solis ac lun&aelig; in corpora humana,
&amp; morbis inde oriundis</i>. At
this time the Newtonian system of
philosophy, from whence our author
had chiefly deduced his reasonings
upon this abstruse subject, were neither
thoroughly understood, nor universally
received: nevertheless whatever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21_1" id="Page_21_1">[21]</a></span>
cavils were raised against his
hypothesis, it was generally admitted,
that his observations had their
uses in practice.</p>

<p>The doctor thought proper to revise
this juvenile production, and to
give a new edition of it in 1748;
when he not only altered the disposition
of some of the <i>old</i>, but also
introduced more than a little <i>new</i>
matter into that work: particularly
he has placed some mathematical
points in a clearer light, than they
before appeared; he has entered
into the discussion of &#8220;a difficult
question, which has raised great
contention among philosophers:
viz. whereas water is more than
eight hundred times heavier than
air, how does it happen, that the
latter when replete with watery
vapours, depresses the mercury in
the barometer; so that its fall is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22_1" id="Page_22_1">[22]</a></span>
an indication of rain?<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>&#8221; he has also
enquired into &#8220;the weight of the
atmosphere on a human body,
and its different pressure at different
times;<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>&#8221; and he has illustrated
and confirmed the medicinal
part by several additional observations
and cases, that promise real
utility to the practice of physic. To
the whole is now first adjoined a
corollary tending to strengthen his
reasonings upon the subject, by observations
of the effects of storms on
the human body; wherein, from the
case of a lady who was seized in an
instant with a <i>gutta serena</i>, (that
rendered her totally blind) on the
night of the great storm which happened
in 1703, he is led to give a
distinct account of the cause and
cure of that melancholly distemper.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23_1" id="Page_23_1">[23]</a></span>This work is also remarkably distinguished
by many curious observations
our author received from his ingenious
preceptor in the art of healing,
Dr. <i>Pitcairne</i>.</p>

<p>Our author&#8217;s distinguished genius
for, and sedulous attention to the
interests of his profession, procured
him an acquisition of farther honours,
as well as recommended him
to the patronage of the most eminent
of the faculty: in 1707 his <i>Paduan
diploma</i> for doctor of physick,
was confirmed by the university of
Oxford; in 1716 he was elected
fellow of the college of physicians,
and served all the offices of that
learned body, except that of president,
which he declined when offered
to him in 1744. Radcliff,
the most followed physician of his
day, in a particular manner espoused
Dr. Mead, and in 1714, upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24_1" id="Page_24_1">[24]</a></span>
death of the former, the latter succeeded
him in his house, and the
greater part of his practice; some
years before which, he had quitted
Stepney, and had resided in Austin
Fryars.</p>

<p>Party-principles were far from influencing
his attachments; though
he was himself a zealous whig, he
was equally the intimate of <i>Garth</i>,
<i>Arbuthnot</i>, and <i>Friend</i>: his connections,
more especially, with the
latter, are manifested not only in
their mutual writings, (of which,
more hereafter) but in that when
Dr. <i>Friend</i> was committed a prisoner
to the Tower in 1723, upon a suggestion
of his being concerned in the
practices of Bishop <i>Atterbury</i> against
the government, Dr. <i>Mead</i> became
one of his securities to procure his
enlargement.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25_1" id="Page_25_1">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>In 1719, an epidemic fever made
great ravages at Marseilles; and tho&#8217;
the French physicians were very unwilling
to admit, this disease to have
been of foreign extraction or contagious;
yet our government wisely
thought it necessary, to consider of
such measures as might be the most
likely to prevent our being visited
by so dangerous a neighbour; or in
failure thereof, to put an early stop
to the progress of the infection. Dr.
<i>Mead</i>, whose deserved reputation
may not unjustly be said to have
merited that mark of distinction,
was consulted on these critical and
important points, by command of
their excellencies, the lords justices
of the kingdom, in his majesty&#8217;s absence:
how equal he was to this
momentous talk, sufficiently appears
from the discourse he published on
that occasion: the approbation this
performance met with, may be estimated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26_1" id="Page_26_1">[26]</a></span>
from the reception it universally
found; seven impressions were
sold of it in the space of one year,
and in the beginning of 1722, the
author gave an eighth, to which he
prefixed a long preface, particularly
calculated to refute what had been
advanced in <i>France</i>, concerning the
absence of contagion in the malady
that had afflicted them: he also now
added a more distinct description of
the plague, and its causes; and confirmed
the utility of the measures he
had recommended, for preventing its
extension, from examples of good
success, where the same had been
put in practice: to these he has
likewise annexed, a short chapter
relating to the cure of this deplorable
affliction.&mdash;In 1744, this work was
carried to a ninth edition, wherein,
to use the doctor&#8217;s own expression,
he has &#8220;here and there added some
new <i>strokes</i> of reasoning, and, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27_1" id="Page_27_1">[27]</a></span>
the painters say, retouched the
<i>ornaments</i>, and heightened the <i>colouring</i>
of the <i>piece</i>.&#8221; Here it may
not be improper to take notice, that
it is in this last impression of his
<i>discourse on the plague</i>, that our author
appears to have first adopted his
theory of the properties and affections
of the <i>nervous fluid</i>, or <i>animal spirits</i>,
upon which he has also founded
his latter reasonings on the subject
of poisons, as well as in respect to the
influence of the sun and moon on
human bodies.</p>

<p>In 1723, Dr. <i>Mead</i> was appointed
to speak the anniversary Harveian
oration, before the members of the
college of physicians, when, ever
studious of the honour of his profession,
he applied himself to wipe
off the obloquy, thought to be reflected
upon it, by those who maintained
the <i>practice</i> of <i>physic</i> at <i>Rome</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28_1" id="Page_28_1">[28]</a></span>
to have been confined to <i>slaves</i> or
<i>freed-men</i>, and not deemed worthy
the attention of an <i>old Roman</i>: which
oration was made publick in 1724,
and to it was annexed, <i>a dissertation
upon some coins, struck by the</i> Smyrn&aelig;ans,
<i>in honour of physicians</i>.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>This publication was smartly attacked
by Dr. <i>Conyers Middleton</i> in
1726,<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> who was replied to by several,
and particularly, as it is said,
by Dr. <i>John Ward</i>, professor of <i>rhetoric</i>
in <i>Gresham College</i>. This gentleman
was supposed by his opponent,
to have been employed by Dr.
<i>Mead</i>, who did not chuse to enter
personally, into this little-important
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29_1" id="Page_29_1">[29]</a></span>debate; upon which presumption,
Dr. <i>Middleton</i> published a defence
of his former dissertation in the succeeding
year;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> wherein he treats his
respondents with no little contempt.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
The merits of this dispute are not
intended to be here discussed, but it
may not be amiss to observe, that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30_1" id="Page_30_1">[30]</a></span>however displeased Dr. <i>Middleton</i>
may have been with his antagonists;
in a work published several years after,
he speaks of our author in the
most respectful manner. In treating
of an antique picture, he says, he
believes it to be the first, and only
one of the sort ever brought to <i>England</i>,
&#8220;<i>donec</i> Meadius <i>noster, artis
medic&aelig; decus, qui vita revera nobilis,
vel principibus in republica
viris, exemplum pr&aelig;bet, pro eo,
quo omnibus fere pr&aelig;stat artium
veterum amore, alias postea quasdam,
&amp; splendidiores, opinor, Roma
quoque deportandas curavit</i>.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

<p>In respect to this controversy, our
author&#8217;s <i>eulogist</i><a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> takes notice that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31_1" id="Page_31_1">[31]</a></span>there is reason to believe, that Dr.
<i>Mead</i> himself had some thoughts of
more determinately explaining or
confirming his sentiments upon this
subject, in a work which he left unfinished,
and which was designed to
have been intitled, <i>medicina vetus
collectitia ex auctoribus antiquis non
medicis</i>.</p>

<p>However, this literary altercation,
did not in the least affect our author&#8217;s
medical reputation, for in
1727, soon after his present Majesty&#8217;s
accession to the throne, whom he
had the honour to serve in the same
capacity while prince of <i>Wales</i>, he
was appointed one of the royal physicians,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32_1" id="Page_32_1">[32]</a></span>and he had the happiness to
see his two sons-in-law, Dr. <i>Willmot</i>
and Dr. <i>Nichols</i>, his co-adjutors
in that eminent station.</p>

<p>After having spent near fifty years
in the constant hurry of an extensive
and successful practice; after
having lived (truely according to his
own motto, <i>non sibi sed toti</i>) beyond
that period assigned by the
royal psalmist for the general term
of mortality; when the infirmities
of age would no longer permit him
the free exercise of those faculties,
which he had hitherto so advantageously
employed in the service of
the community, far from sinking
into a supine indolence, or assuming
a supercilious disregard of the world,
he still continued his application,
even in the decline of life, to the
improvement of physic, and the benefit
of mankind.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33_1" id="Page_33_1">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>When he was grown unequal to
the discharge of more active functions,
and a retirement was become
absolutely necessary, he took the opportunity
of revising all his former
writings: to this retreat therefore,
and the happy protraction of so useful
a life, the world is indebted for
the improvements that appear in the
latter editions of those works, which
have already been taken notice of.
It was not till now that our author
could find leisure to perfect his <i>discourse
on the small pox and measles</i>,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a>
which had been begun by him many
years before.</p>

<p>As it was the principal design of
these <i>memoirs</i>, to lay before the public
a concise and comprehensive history
of Dr. <i>Mead</i>&#8217;s writings, the occasion
of this universally admired performance,
cannot be better given than from
the author&#8217;s own account, contained in
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34_1" id="Page_34_1">[34]</a></span>the preface to it, in which also his
connections with, and attachment to
Dr. <i>Friend</i>, are further illustrated.</p>

<p>It appears that Dr. <i>Mead</i>, from
having observed in the year 1708,
that some of his patients in St. <i>Thomas&#8217;s
Hospital</i>, recovered from a
very malignant sort of the small
pox, even beyond expectation, by a
looseness seizing them on the ninth
or tenth day of the disease, and
sometimes earlier, first took the hint
to try what might be done by opening
the body with a gentle purge,
on the decline of the distemper;
finding the success of this experiment
in a great measure answerable
to his wishes, he communicated
this method of practice to Dr. <i>Friend</i>,
and met with his approbation.</p>

<p>The latter being, soon after, called
to a consultation with two other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35_1" id="Page_35_1">[35]</a></span>
eminent physicians, on the case of a
young nobleman who lay dangerously
ill of the small pox, proposed our
author&#8217;s method; this was opposed
till the fourteenth day from the eruption,
when the case appearing
desperate, they consented to give him
a gentle laxative draught; which
had a very good effect: Dr. <i>Friend</i>
was of opinion to repeat it, but was
over-ruled, and the patient died the
seventh day after.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p>From the result of this case, the
gentlemen of the faculty were greatly
divided in opinion, as to the rectitude
of this practice, insomuch that
Dr. <i>Friend</i> thought himself under a
necessity of vindicating it; and therefore
sent to our author for the purport
of their former conversation
upon this topic, desiring it might
be reduced into writing. Such was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36_1" id="Page_36_1">[36]</a></span>the friendship that mutually subsisted
between these learned men, that
this request was granted without hesitation,
and Dr. <i>Mead</i>&#8217;s letter was
shewn to Dr. <i>Radcliffe</i>, who prevailed
upon our author to consent, that
the same might be annexed to Dr.
<i>Friend</i>&#8217;s intended <i>defence</i>; which,
however he was advised by some
friends, to drop at that time; whereby
this letter lay by till the latter&#8217;s
publication of <i>the first and third
books of Hippocrates&#8217;s epidemics</i>, illustrated
with <i>nine commentaries concerning
fevers</i>. Of these the <i>seventh</i>
treats of <i>purging in the putrid fever,
which follows upon the confluent small
pox</i>: to which are annexed, in support
of this opinion, letters from four
physicians on that subject, and among
them that from our author, which
he had translated from the english
into latin, enlarged and new modelled
to serve this purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37_1" id="Page_37_1">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>This work gave rise to a controversy,
maintained with an unbecoming
warmth on both sides: among
Dr. <i>Friend</i>&#8217;s principal opponents,
may be reckoned Dr. <i>Woodward</i>;
who, not contented with condemning
a practice, experience has since
evinced not only salutary in general,
but in many cases absolutely necessary;
likewise treated its favourers
with contempt and ill-manners, and
more particularly our author;<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> whose
resentment upon this occasion, appears
to have been carried to a justly
exceptionable length, seeing it had
not subsided twenty years after the
death of his antagonist.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38_1" id="Page_38_1">[38]</a></span></p><p>Dr. <i>Mead</i>&#8217;s daily acquisition of
knowledge and experience, enabled
him to enlarge to many beneficial
purposes, this performance, which,
in all probability, was at first designed
only to illustrate and vindicate
the sentiments contained in the aforementioned
letter; and it is but justice
to say, the applause it has found
among the learned, as well for the
elegance of its diction, as the perspicuity
of its precepts, is no more
than what is truely due to it.&mdash;&mdash;To
this discourse is subjoin&#8217;d a latin translation,
from the arabic of <i>Rhazes</i>&#8217;s
treatise on the <i>small pox</i> and <i>measles</i>,
a copy of the original having been
obtained for this purpose by Dr. <i>Mead</i>,
from the celebrated <i>Boerhaave</i>, between
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39_1" id="Page_39_1">[39]</a></span>whom there had long subsisted
an intimate correspondence, nor
did their reciprocally differing in
some opinions, diminish the friendship
they mutually manifested for
each other.</p>

<p>The year 1749, furnished two
new productions from our author; a
translation of one of which follows
these memoirs. The other is entitled,
<i>a discourse on the scurvy</i>, affixed to
Mr. <i>Sutton</i>&#8217;s second edition of his
<i>method for extracting the foul air
out of ships</i>.</p>

<p>It is more than possible that, but,
for the patronage of Dr. <i>Mead</i>, this
contrivance, which confers no less
honour to the inventor, than utility
to the public, might have been for

no one more ardently wished for, or
more zealously promoted the glory<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40_1" id="Page_40_1">[40]</a></span>
and interest of his country, being
thoroughly convinced of its efficacy,
so earnestly, and so effectually recommended
it to the lords of the admiralty,
as to prevail over the obstinate
opposition that was made against
its being put into practice. To the
same purpose in 1742, he explained
the nature and conveniencies of this
invention to the royal society,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> and
with the same view he confessedly
wrote the last mentioned discourse,
of which he made a present to Mr.
<i>Sutton</i>.</p>

<p>His <i>medical precepts</i> and <i>cautions</i>,
which appeared in 1751, and was
his last publication, affords an indisputable
testimony, that length of
years had not in the least impaired
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41_1" id="Page_41_1">[41]</a></span>his intellectual faculties. Our author
has herein furnished the public, with
the principal helps against most diseases
which he had either learned by
long practice, or deduced from rational
principles.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Who could with
the same propriety take upon himself
to be an instructor and legislator in
the medical world, as he who had
been taught to distinguish truth from
falsehood, in the course of so extended
an experience, protracted now
to almost threescore years? to this
may be added, that he has so contrived
to blend the <i>utile dulci</i>, by
embellishing his precepts with all the
delicacy of polite expression, as to
render them at the same time not
less entertaining than instructive.</p>

<p>However, this work was productive
of two other little pieces, from
two gentlemen of the faculty: one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42_1" id="Page_42_1">[42]</a></span>by Dr. <i>Summers</i>; who in a pamphlet
<i>on the success of warm bathing
in paralytic cases</i>, controverts Dr.
<i>Mead</i>&#8217;s assertion, that &#8220;hot bathing
is prejudicial to all paralytics&#8221; ...
&#8220;<i>calid&aelig; vero immersiones omnibus paralyticis
nocent</i><a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>.&#8221;&mdash;Some reflections
upon the advocates for Mrs.
<i>Stephens</i>&#8217;s medicines, in the cure of
the stone and gravel, by our author,
occasioned a letter to him on that
subject by Dr. <i>Hartley</i> of <i>Bath</i>.
The former expressed himself in the
following manner; &#8220;<i>Neque temperare
mihi possum, quin dicam in
opprobrium nuper medicis nonnullis
cessisse, quod insano pretio redimendi
anile remedium magnatibus
auctores fuerunt.</i><a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a>&#8221; ... &#8220;Nor can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43_1" id="Page_43_1">[43]</a></span>I forbear observing, tho&#8217; I am extremely
sorry for the occasion,
that some gentlemen of the faculty
a few years since acted a
part much beneath their characters,
first in suffering themselves to
be imposed on, and then in encouraging
the legislature to purchase
an old woman&#8217;s medicine at an
exorbitant price.&#8221;<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> Of this the latter
complains as an unmerited indignity,
&#8220;<i>Illud interea</i> (inquit) <i>tanquem
inopinatum, &amp; ab &aelig;quitate
tua alienum queri liceat</i>, <span class="smcap">Te</span>, <i>qui

non potius laudi illis dedisse, quod

jactatoribus tamen &amp; falsiloquis
esset impervia.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></i>&#8221; ... In the
mean while, I cannot but complain
of it as a thing unexpected, and
greatly inconsistent with your usual
candour, that <small>YOU</small>, who are so courteous
and humane to all mankind,
and so remarkably the patron of those
who excel in the profession of physic,
or indeed in any branch of learning,
should so severely reproach the favourers
of this lithontriptic medicine;
and not rather have commended
them, for submitting a secret,
communicated to them without fee
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45_1" id="Page_45_1">[45]</a></span>or reward, to the examination of
some worthy physicians, eminent for
integrity, ingenuity, and learning:
and for endeavouring to excite the
munificence of the publick in such a
manner only, as to render it accessible
to the true authors of an important
discovery, but impervious to
boasting impostors.</p>

<p>In enumerating the obligations the
republic of letters is under to Dr.
<i>Mead</i>, it would be injustice to omit
taking notice, that to his generosity
and public spirit, it is farther indebted
for the first complete edition
of the celebrated history of <i>Thuanus</i>.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>To enlarge upon his literary collections,
and other curiosities, would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46_1" id="Page_46_1">[46]</a></span>at present be useless, seeing the world
will soon be apprized of their value
and contents from the catalogues that
are already, and are yet about to
be published of them; it may therefore
suffice to say, that he did not
shew more assiduity and judgment
in collecting them, than he did candour
and generosity in permitting the
use of them to all that were competent
judges, or that could benefit
themselves, or the public by them.</p>

<p>It may, perhaps not unjustly, be
said no Subject in <i>Europe</i> had a cabinet
so richly and so judiciously filled;
to which the correspondence he
maintained with the learned in all
parts of <i>Europe</i>, not a little contributed;
nor can there be an higher
instance given of his reputation in
this respect, than in the king of <i>Naples</i>
having sent him the two first
volumes of M. <i>Bajurdi</i>&#8217;s account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47_1" id="Page_47_1">[47]</a></span>
the antiquities found in <i>Herculaneum</i>,
with the additional compliment
of asking in return, <i>only</i>, a compleat
collection of our author&#8217;s works,
to which was adjoined, an invitation
to visit that newly discovered subterraneous
city: an invitation that could
not but be greatly pleasing to a genius
so inquisitive after knowledge,
and which he declared, he should
very gladly have embraced, had not
his advanced years been an insuperable
impediment, to the gratification
of his curiosity. In short, his
character abroad was so well known
and established, that a foreigner of
any taste, would have thought it a
reproach to him, to have been in
<i>England</i> without seeing Dr. <i>Mead</i>.</p>

<p>As his knowledge was not limited
only to his profession, the deserving
in all sciences had not only free access
to him, but always found a welcome<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48_1" id="Page_48_1">[48]</a></span>
reception, and at his table
might daily be seen together the naturalist,
the antiquarian, the mathematician,
and the mechanic, with
all whom he was capable of conversing
in their respective terms; here
might be seen united the magnificence
of a prince, with the pleasures
of the wise.</p>

<p>His munificence was conspicuous
in that there was no remarkable publick
charity to which he was not a
benefactor, particularly he was one
of the earliest promoters of, and subscribers
to the <i>Foundling hospital</i>.</p>

<p>Let these specimens of his superior
abilities and merit suffice for the
present, nor let envy or detraction
attempt to sully so exalted a character.&mdash;Soon
after the publication
of his <i>monita &amp; pr&aelig;cepta medica</i>,
this ornament of his profession, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49_1" id="Page_49_1">[49]</a></span>
delight of his acquaintance, grew
more and more sensible of the natural
infirmities attending his length of
years; and with the utmost tranquillity
and resignation, quietly sunk
into the arms of death on the 16th
of <i>February</i> 1754. To whom may,
with the greatest propriety, be applied
a part of the epitaph inscribed
to the memory of the celebrated
<i>Guicciardini</i>, at <i>Florence</i>;</p>

PREFACE.</h2>


<div class="initial" style="clear: both">
<img src="images/initial2.jpg" alt="M" title="M" /></div>
<p class="dropcapsection">Y declining years having
in a great measure
released me from
those medical fatigues,
in which, for the publick
good, (at least as I hope) I
have been employed about fifty
years, I have determined to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ii" id="Page_ii">[ii]</a></span>
pass the short remains of life in
such a sort of leisure, as may
prove neither disagreeable to
myself, nor useless to others.
For good men are of opinion,
that we must give an account
even of our idle hours, and
therefore thought it necessary,
that they should be always
well-spent.</p>

<p>Having from my earliest
childhood entertained a strong
passion for learning, after I
had chosen the art of medicine
for my profession, I still never
intermitted my literary studies;
to which I had recourse from
time to time, as to refreshments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iii" id="Page_iii">[iii]</a></span>
strengthening me in my daily
labours, and charming my cares.
Thus, among other subjects, I
frequently read the holy scriptures,
as becomes a christian;
and next to those things which
regard eternal life, and the doctrine
of morality, I usually
gave particular attention to the
histories of diseases, and the
various ailments therein recorded;
comparing those with
what I had learnt either from
medical writers or my own experience.
And this I did the
more willingly, because I had
remarked that divines, thro&#8217; an
unacquaintance with medicinal
knowledge, frequently differed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_iv" id="Page_iv">[iv]</a></span>
widely in their sentiments; especially
on the subject of d&aelig;moniacs
cured by the power of
our saviour Jesus Christ. For
it is the opinion of many, that
these were really possessed with
devils, and that his divine virtue
shone forth in nothing more
conspicuous than in expelling
them. I am very far from
having the least intention to
undermine the foundations of
the christian doctrine, or to
endeavour, by a perverse interpretation
of the sacred oracles,
to despoil the Son of God
of his divinity, which he has
demonstrated by so many and
great works performed contrary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_v" id="Page_v">[v]</a></span>
to the laws of nature.
Truth stands no more in need
of the patronage of error, than
does a natural good complexion
of paint. And it is
certain, that the opinion which
has been prevalent for many
ages, of the power granted to
devils, of torturing human bodies
and minds, has been several
ways made subservient to
the subtle designs of crafty
men, to the very great detriment
and shame of the christian
religion.</p>

<p>What sensible man can avoid
justly deriding those solemn
ceremonies, practised by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
the roman priests, in exorcising,
as they are fond of terming it,
d&aelig;moniacs: while proper persons
(hired and) taught to counterfeit
certain gestures and fits
of fury, such as are believed to
be caused by evil spirits, pretend
that they are freed from
devils, and restored to their
senses by holy water, and certain
prayers, as by inchantment.
But these juggling tricks,
how grosly soever they may
impose on the eyes and minds
of the ignorant multitude, not
only scandalize, but also do a
real injury to, men of greater
penetration. For such, seeing
into the cheat, often rush headlong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
into impiety; and viewing
all sacred things in the
same light, after they have
learnt</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">
<i>Relligionibus atque minis obsistere vatum:</i><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a>
</span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">they advance farther, and by an
abominable effort, endeavour
thoroughly to root out of their
minds all sense and fear of the
supreme deity. In which proceeding
they act as if a person
doubted of the existence of the
<i>Indies</i>, because travellers relate
many falshoods and fictions
concerning them. Hence it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
comes to pass, that, in countries
too much given up to superstition,
very many atheists
are to be met with even among
the learned, whom their learning
and knowledge ought to secure
from these errors. Therefore
to be free from this folly,
is the principal part of wisdom;
next to which, is not to
corrupt truth with fictitious
opinions.</p>

<p>And indeed it is frequently
to me a matter of wonder, why
our spiritual guides so strenuously
insist on exhibiting
devils on the stage, in order to
make the divinity of Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
triumph over these infernal enemies.
Is Christ&#8217;s divine power
less manifested by the cure of
the most grievous diseases, performed
in an instant at his
command; than by the expulsion
of evil spirits out of the
bodies of men? Certainly all
the wonderful things done by
him for the good of mankind,
such as restoring sight to the
blind, firmness and flexibility
to relaxed or contracted nerves,
calling the dead to life, changing
the properties of the elements,
and others of the same
kind, are testimonies of the
omnipotence of the creator of
the world, and demonstrate the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
presence of God; who alone
commands all nature, and at
his pleasure changes and inverts
the order of things established
by himself. Wherefore
it cannot be doubted, that
He, who has perform&#8217;d these
things, had the devils subject
to him, that they might not
obstruct his gracious resolution
of revealing the will of his father
to men, and correcting
their depraved morals.</p>

<p>But to resume the subject
of d&aelig;moniacs, the opinion,
which I propose in this treatise,
is not purely my own, but
also of several other persons,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
before me, eminent for piety
and learning. And indeed among
our own countrymen, it
was in the last century defended
in an excellent dissertation,
by that treasure of sacred
knowledge, the reverend <i>Joseph
Mead</i>. Wherefore as I
have the honour to be of the
same family with him, and
am the son of <i>Matthew Mead</i>,
a very able divine, I always
thought I might lay some claim
to these studies, by a kind of
hereditary right.</p>

<p>I am not insensible of the
difficulty of removing vulgar
errors, especially those which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
relate to religion. For every
body knows the power of education,
in imprinting on the
mind notions, which are hard
to be effaced even in adult
age. Children in the dark, fear
ghosts and hobgoblins; and
hence often quake with the
same fear through the whole
course of their lives. Why
then do we admire, if we can
hardly unlearn, and clear our
minds of, some false notions,
even when we are advancing
to old age? Nor will this be
deemed indeed a matter of
little importance by him, who
considers the serious evils, into
which mankind are often led,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
by things that to some may
appear trifling, as being nothing
more than bugbears of
children and women. My soul
is seized with horror on recollecting,
how many millions of
innocent persons have been
condemned to the flames in
various nations, since the birth
of Christ, upon the bare suspicion
of witchcraft: while the
very judges were perhaps either
blinded by vain prejudices, or
dreaded the incensed populace,
if they acquitted those, whom
the mob had previously adjudged
guilty. Who would
believe that any man in his
right senses could boast, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
matter of merit, that he had
capitally condemned about nine
hundred persons for witchcraft,
in the space of fifteen years, in
the sole dutchy of <i>Lorraine</i>?<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
And yet from many histories,
which he relates of those who
suffered, it manifestly appears,
that every individual of these
criminals, had no compacts
with devils, as they themselves
imagined, but were really mad,
so as openly to confess that
they had done such feats as are
impossible in the nature of
things. But so it happens,
that error generally begets superstition,
and superstition cruelty.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>Wherefore I most heartily
rejoice, that I have lived to see
all our laws relating to witchcraft
entirely abolished: whereas
foreign states still retain this
barbarous cruelty, and with
various degrees of obstinacy in
proportion to their ignorance
of natural causes. And it is
but too true, that the doctrine
of d&aelig;mons is so understood by
the vulgar, as if the devil was
to be esteemed a sort of deity;
or at least, that, laying the
fear of him aside, no divine
worship can well subsist; altho&#8217;
the apostle has expresly said;
<i>For this purpose the Son of
God was manifested, that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
might destroy the works of the
devil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>And here it may not be improper,
once for all, to inform
the reader, that I have generally
made use of <i>Sebastian
Castalio</i>&#8217;s version of the bible,
because, upon collating it in
many places, I found it to be
not only excellent Latin, but
also very accurate, and particularly
well adapted to the
sense and meaning of the words
in the Hebrew and Greek.</p>

<p>Nor can I refrain from declaring,
that I have not writ
these essays for the profane or
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[xvii]</a></span>vulgar; but for those only
who are well versed, or at least
initiated in theological or medical
studies: and for this reason
I chose to publish it in
Latin; which language has
for many ages past been made
use of by learned men; in order
to communicate to each
other, whatsoever might seem
to them either new, or expressed
in a different manner from
the common notions. Wherefore
if any person should intend
to publish an English version
of this book, I give him
this timely notice, that he will
do it, not only against my
will; but likewise in direct<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[xviii]</a></span>
opposition to that equitable
law, whereby every man is allowed
to dispose of his own
property according to his pleasure.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a></p>

<p>But to bring this preface to
a conclusion; it is manifest
that the christian religion requires
of all its members in a
most especial manner, to practice
every act of humanity and
benevolence towards each other.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[xix]</a></span>Wherefore the utmost care
ought to be taken, that this
beneficent disposition of mind
be not corrupted by any means
whatsoever: and nothing contributes
more towards bringing
on this corruption, than opinions
derogatory from the divine
goodness. Upon this account,
as such is the misfortune
of our times, that it is
not only allowed, but even by
many deemed a commendable
action, to oppugn, and by
every method to invalidate, the
doctrine and authority of the
christian religion; no interpretations
of the histories of miracles
ought to be look&#8217;d upon as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[xx]</a></span>
out of season, provided they
appear neither improbable, nor
repugnant to the nature of the
facts related.</p>

<p>In fine, it was not my intention
to treat of every disease
mentioned in holy writ;
but to confine myself more
particularly to those, the nature
of which is generally but
little known, or at least to such
as I had some peculiar medicine
for, or method of cure,
to offer to the public; and to
perform this task, in the same
order, in which they occur in
those sacred writings: excepting
only <i>Job</i>&#8217;s disease, to which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[xxi]</a></span>
I have given the first place, on
account of the great antiquity
of that book. The Saviour of
the world, in order to make
his divine power manifest to
mankind, cured many other
diseases, both of the body and
mind, besides those which I
have mentioned in this work:
the nature and causes of all
which diseases, whosoever would
intend to enquire into, must of
necessity compile a body of
physic, which was not my present
design. But if providence
protract my life, I am not
without hopes of laying more
of my thoughts on this subject
before the public, for the honour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[xxii]</a></span>
which I bear to my profession,

<h3><i>The Disease of Job.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ob&#8217;s</span> disease is rendered remarkable
by some uncommon circumstances
and consequences; such as
the dignity of the man, the sudden
change of his condition, his extraordinary
adversity, his incredible patience
under them, his restoration to
a much happier state than he had
ever before enjoyed, and lastly the
singular nature of the illness with
which he was seized.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span></p>

<p>His habitation was in the land of
<i>Uz</i>, which, according to the learned
<i>Friderick Spanheim</i>,<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> was situated in
the northern part of <i>Arabia deserta</i>,
towards the <i>Euphrates</i> and <i>Mesopotamia</i>.
He was a very illustrious man,
the most opulent of all the Orientals,
very happy in sons and daughters, of
a most upright life and exemplary piety.
Now it is related that God, in
order to try his integrity and constancy,
permitted Satan to afflict him
by all means which he could devise,
except the taking away of his life.
&#8220;In pursuance of this permission, Satan
brought the most dreadful calamities
on him; for all his oxen
and asses were driven away by the
Sabeans; his sheep and servants
were consumed by fire from heaven;
his camels were carried off;
his sons and daughters were crush&#8217;d
to death by the falling in of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>house upon them in a violent storm
of wind; and soon after he himself
was afflicted with scabs and foul
ulcers all over his body; so that
he sate down among the ashes, and
scraped himself with a potsherd.&#8221;
Thus from a very rich man he became
extremely poor, and from the heighth
of prosperity he sunk into the depth
of misery. And yet all these evils
did not give the least shock to his
firmness of mind, nor to his piety towards
God:<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> wherefore the Lord,
moved by his prayers, put an end to
all his calamities; gave him twice as
much wealth as he had lost, and
made him more prosperous than he
had ever been before.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>Now the book of Job may justly
be esteemed the most ancient of all
books, of which we have any certain
account: for some are of opinion that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>it was written in the times of the patriarchs;
many others, that it was
composed about the days of Moses,
and even by Moses himself; and there
are but few who think it posterior to
him.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> For my part, I embrace the
learned Lightfoot&#8217;s opinion, that it
was composed by Elihu, one of
Job&#8217;s companions, chiefly because he
therein speaks of himself as of the
writer of this history,<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and if so, it
will appear to be older than the days
of Moses. However this be, it is most
certain that this book carries with it
manifest tokens of very great antiquity;
the most material of which seem
to be these. In it there is not the
least mention made of the departure
of the Israelites out of Egypt, of Moses,
or the Mosaic Law. After the
manner of the Patriarchs, Job, as the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>head of his family, offered sacrifices
in his own private house, for the sins
of his children.<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> When he declares
his integrity he scarcely mentions any
other Idolatry, but that most ancient
one, the worship of the sun and
moon,<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> which we know to be very
old, and to have first obtained among
the neighbouring Chaldeans, and
Ph&#339;nicians. In fine his own age, protracted
far beyond the life of man in
Moses&#8217;s time, is a proof of its antiquity,
for he lived a hundred and forty
years after an end had been put to his
calamities; so that it is reasonable to
believe that he lived above two hundred
years in all. For that he was
aged, when his misfortunes crowded
on him, may be hence inferred, that,
altho&#8217; his three friends are stiled old
men,<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> yet in his disputes with them,
he does not seem to honour them for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>their age, as Elihu does. To avoid
prolixity, I join with Spanheim in
opinion, that Job&#8217;s time coincides
with the bondage of the children of
Israel in Egypt, so as to be neither
posterior to their quitting that country,
nor anterior to their entering it.</p>

<p>But there subsists a dispute of a
different nature between very grave
authors, and that is, whether this
narrative be a fable or a true history:
If I were allowed to interpose my
opinion, I would say, that it is not
a parable invented by &#8017;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#8059;&#960;&#969;&#963;&#953;&#962;, but a
dramatic poem composed upon a true
history; and perhaps with this design,
that from the example of this
illustrious and upright, yet afflicted
and most miserable man, the people
of Israel might learn to bear with patience,
all those evils and hardships,
which they were daily suffering in
their Egyptian captivity. That this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
book is metrical, as well as <i>David</i>&#8217;s
<i>Psalms</i>, the <i>Proverbs</i>, <i>Ecclesiastes</i>,
and <i>Solomon</i>&#8217;s <i>Song</i>, is generally allowed:
and the persons of the drama
are God, Satan, Job and his
wife, his three friends, and Elihu.
<i>Wherefore it is</i>, says Grotius, <i>a real
fact, but poetically handled</i>.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> Poetry
was certainly a very ancient manner
of writing, and poets were wont to
embellish true histories in their own
way, as we see in the most ancient
among the Greeks and Romans. And
among the Hebrews likewise, long
after the time above-mentioned, Ezechiel
comprised the history of the departure
out of Egypt in a dramatic
poem; upon which account he is
called by Clemens Alexandrinus, <i>the
poet of Judaic tragedies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Nor indeed,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>in my opinion, can there be
found, in this kind of writing, any
thing more admirable, and better
adapted to move the passions than
this piece; whether we regard the
sublimity and elegance of style, the
description of natural things, or in
fine, the propriety of the characters
ascribed to all the persons concerned
in it; all which circumstances are of
the greatest moment in a dramatic
performance.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">The nearer you behold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The more it strikes you.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before I close this chapter, it may
not be improper to offer my conjecture
concerning the disease of this
illustrious man. But previous to this,
it is proper to remark, that it is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Job himself, or his friends, but the
author of the book that attributes his
calamities to Satan; for this author&#8217;s
intention seems to be, to shew, by a
striking example, that the world is
governed by the providence of Almighty
God, and as the holy angels,
whose ministry God makes use of
in distributing his bountiful gifts,
punctually execute all his commands;
so Satan himself with his agents
are under the power of God, and
cannot inflict any evils on mankind
without the divine permission.
Thus, <i>when the Sons of God</i> (angels)
<i>came and presented themselves before
the Lord</i>, it is said that <i>Satan came
also among them</i>. Now the word
<i>astare</i> to present one&#8217;s self, as Moses
Maimonides<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> observes, signifies to be
prepared to receive Jehovah&#8217;s commands,
but Satan came of his own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>accord and mixed with them without
any summons.</p>

<p>Now as to the disease, it is plain
that it was cuticular, and as it is certain
that the bodies of the Hebrews
were very liable to foul ulcers of the
skin from time immemorial; upon
which account it is, that learned men
are of opinion that they were forbid
the eating of swine&#8217;s flesh (which, as
it affords a gross nourishment, and
not easily perspirable, is very improper
food in such constitutions) wherefore
by how much hotter the countries
were which they inhabited,
such as are the desarts of Arabia,
the more severely these disorders
raged. And authors of other nations,
who despised and envied the
Jews, say that it was upon this account
that they were driven out of
Egypt; lest the leprosy, a disease
common among them, should spread<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
over the country.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> But there is another
much worse disease, so frequent
in Egypt, that it is said to be endemial
there,<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> though it may also be
engendered in this hot country, I
mean the Elephantiasis. Perhaps it
was this, which is nearly of the same
nature with the leprosy, that had affected
the body of our righteous
man: but on this subject we shall
treat more largely in the subsequent
chapter.</p>

<h3><i>The Leprosy.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span></span> most severe disease, to which
the bodies of the Jews were
very subject, was the Leprosy. Its
signs recorded in the holy scriptures
are chiefly these. Pimples arose in
the skin; the hair was turned white;
the plague (or sore) in sight was deeper
than the skin, when the disease
had been of long standing; a white
tumour appeared in the skin, in which
there was quick flesh; the foul eruptions
gained ground daily, and at
length covered the whole surface of
the body. And the evil is said to infect,
not only the human body, but
also the cloaths and garments, nay
(what may seem strange) utensils
made of skins or furs, and even the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
very walls of the houses. Wherefore
there are precepts laid down for cleansing
these also, as well as the lepers.</p>

<p>Medical authors are of different
opinions concerning the contagion
of this disease. And whereas neither
the Arabian nor Greek physicians,
who have treated largely of the leprosy,
have given the least hint of this
extraordinary force of it, whereby it
may infect cloaths and walls of
houses; the Rabbin doctors dispute,
whether that which seized the Jews,
was not intirely different from the
common leprosy; and they all
affirm, that <i>there never appeared in
the World, a leprosy of cloaths and
houses, except only in Judea, and
among the sole people of Israel</i>.</p>

<p>For my part, I shall now freely
propose, what I think most probable
on the subject. One kind of contagion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
is more subtile than another;
for there is a sort, which is taken into
the body by the very breath; such
as I have elsewhere said to exist in
the plague, small pox, and other
malignant fevers. But there is another
sort, which infects by contact
alone; either internal, as the venom
of the venereal disease; or external,
as that of the itch, which is conveyed
into the body by rubbing against
cloaths, whether woollen or linnen.
Wherefore the leprosy, which is a species
of the itch, may pass into a sound
man in this last manner; perhaps also
by cohabitation; as Fracastorius has
observed, that <i>a consumption is contagious,
and is contracted by living with
a phthisical person, by the gliding of
the corrupted and putrefied juices</i> of
the sick <i>into the lungs of the sound
man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> And <i>Aret&aelig;us</i> is of the same
opinion with regard to the Elephantiasis,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>a disease nearly allied to the
Leprosy: for he gives this caution,
&#8220;That it is not less dangerous to converse
and live with persons affected
with this distemper, than with those
infected with the plague; because
the contagion is communicated by
the inspired<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> air.&#8221;</p>

<p>But here occurs a considerable
difficulty. For Moses says, &#8220;If in the
leprosy there be observed a white tumour
in the skin, and it have turned
the hair white in it, and there be
quick flesh within the tumour; it is
an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh.
But if the leprosy spread broad in the
skin, and cover the whole skin of the
diseased from his head even to his
feet, the person shall be pronounced<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a><br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">clean.&#8221; But the difficulty contained</span><br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>in this passage will vanish, if we suppose,
as it manifestly appears to me,
that it points out two different species
of the disease; the one in which
the eroded skin was ulcerated, so that
the quick flesh appeared underneath;
the other, which spread on the surface
of the skin only in the form of
rough scales. And from this difference
it happened, that the former
species was, and the latter was not,
contagious. For these scales, being
dry and light like bran, do not penetrate
into the skin; whereas the purulent
matter issuing from the ulcers
infects the surface of the body. But
concerning the differences of cuticular
diseases, I heartily recommend to
the reader&#8217;s perusal, what Johannes
Manardus, equally valuable for his
medical knowledge and the purity of
his Latin, has written upon the subject.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<p>There is no time, in which this
disease was not known; but it was
always more severe in Syria and
Egypt, as they are hotter countries,
than in Greece and other parts of
Europe; and it is even at this day
frequent in those regions. For I
have been assured by travellers, that
there are two hospitals for the leprous
alone in Damascus. And there is a
fountain at Edessa, in which great
numbers of people affected with this
cuticular foulness wash daily, as was
the ancient custom.</p>

<p>Moreover we read the principal
signs, which occur in the description
of the Mosaic leprosy, excepting only
the infection of the cloaths and
houses (of which by and by) recorded
by the Greek Physicians. Hippocrates
himself calls the &#955;&#949;&#8017;&#954;&#951; or white
leprosy &#934;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#7985;&#951; &#957;&#547;&#963;&#959;&#962; the Ph&#339;nician disease.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a>
For that the word &#966;&#977;&#953;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#8052; ought
to be read &#934;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#7985;&#951;], appears manifestly
from Galen in his <i>Explicatio linguarum
Hippocratis</i>; where he says
that &#934;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#953;&#954;&#7985;&#951; &#957;&#547;&#963;&#959;&#962; is a disease which is
<i>frequent in Ph&#339;nicia and other eastern
regions</i>.<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In the foregoing chapter I
said that the Leprosy (Leuce) and the
Elephantiasis, were diseases of great
affinity:<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> in confirmation of which
notion the same Galen observes, that
the one sometimes changes into the
other.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Now these two distempers
are no where better described than
by Celsus, who lived about the time
of Augustus C&aelig;sar, and having collected
the works of the principal
Greek writers in physic and surgery,
digested them into order, and turned
them into elegant Latin with great
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>judgment. Thus he describes the
leprous diseases. <i>Three are three species
of the</i> Vitiligo. <i>It is named</i> &#7940;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;,
<i>when it is of a white colour, with some
degree of roughness, and is not continuous,
but appears as if some little
drops were dispersed here and there;
sometimes it spreads wider, but with
certain intermissions or discontinuities.
The</i> &#956;&#7953;&#955;&#945;&#962; <i>differs from this in
colour, because it is black, and like a
shadow, but in other circumstances
they agree. The</i> &#955;&#949;&#8059;&#954;&#951; <i>has some similitude
with the</i> &#7940;&#955;&#966;&#959;&#962;, <i>but it has more of
the white, and runs in deeper: and
in it the hairs are white, and like
down. All these spread themselves,
but in some persons quicker, in others
slower. The</i> Alphos <i>and</i> Melas <i>come
on, and go off some people at different
times; but the</i> Leuce <i>does not easily
quit the patient, whom it has seized.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a>
But in the Elephantiasis</i>, says the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>same author, <i>the whole body is so affected,
that the very bones may be said
to be injured. The surface of the body
has a number of spots and tumors on
it; and their redness is by degrees
changed into a dusky or blackish colour.
The surface of the skin is unequally
thick and thin, hard and soft; and
is scaley and rough: the body is emaciated;
the mouth, legs and feet swell.
When the disease is inveterate, the
nails on the fingers and toes are hidden
by the swelling.</i><a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> And the accounts
left us by the Arabian physicians,
agree with these descriptions.
Avicenna, the chief of them, says
that <i>the Leprosy is a sort of universal
cancer of the whole body</i>.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> Wherefore
it plainly appears from all that has
been said, that the Syrian Leprosy
did not differ in nature, but in degree
only, from the Grecian, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>was there called  &#955;&#949;&#8059;&#954;&#951;; and that this
same disease had an affinity with the
Elephantiasis, sometimes among the
Greeks, but very much among the
Arabs. For the climate and manner
of living, very much aggravates all
cuticular diseases.</p>

<p>Now with regard to the infection
of the cloaths, it has been found by
most certain experiments, not only
in the plague, and some other malignant
eruptive fevers, as the small
pox and measles, but even in the
common itch; that the infection,
once received into all sorts of furs or
skins, woollen, linnen, and silk, remains
a long time in them, and
thence passes into human bodies.
Wherefore it is easy to conceive, that
the leprous miasmata might pass from
such materials into the bodies of
those, who either wore or handled
them, and, like seeds sown, produce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
the disease peculiar to them. For it
is well known, that the surface of
the body, let it appear ever so soft
and smooth, is not only full of pores,
but also of little furrows, and therefore
is a proper nest for receiving and
cherishing the minute, but very active,
particles exhaling from infected
bodies. But I have treated this subject
in a more extensive manner in
my <i>Discourse on the Plague</i>.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> And
these seeds of contagion are soon
mixed with an acrid and salt humor,
derived from the blood; which as it
naturally ought, partly to have turned
into nutriment, and partly to have
perspired through the skin, it now
lodges, and corrodes the little scales
of the cuticle; and these becoming
dry and white, sometimes even as
white as snow, are separated from the
skin, and fall off like bran. Now,
altho&#8217; this disease is very uncommon
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>in our colder climate; yet I have seen
one remarkable case of it, in a countryman,
whose whole body was so
miserably seized by it, that his skin
was shining as if covered with snow:
and as the furfuraceous scales were
daily rubbed off, the flesh appeared
quick or raw underneath. This
wretch had constantly lived in a
swampy place, and was obliged to
support himself with bad diet and
foul water.</p>

<p>But it is much more difficult to account
for the infection of the houses.
For it seems hardly possible in nature,
that the leprous spots should
grow and spread on dry walls, made
of solid materials. But upon a serious
consideration of the different substances
employed in building the
walls of houses, such as stones, lime,
bituminous earth, hair of animals,
and other such things mix&#8217;d together;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
I thought it probable, that
they may by a kind of fermentation,
produce those <i>hollow greenish or reddish
strokes in sight lower than the
wall</i> (or within the surface)<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which,
as they in some measure resembled
the leprous scabs on the human body,
were named the <i>Leprosy in a house</i>.
For bodies of different natures, very
easily effervesce upon being blended
together. Wherefore we may reasonably
suppose that this moisture or
mouldiness, gradually coming forth
and spreading on the walls, might
prove very prejudicial to the inhabitants,
by its stinking and unwholesome
smell, without having recourse
to any contagious quality in it. And
somewhat analogous to this is pretty
frequently observable in our own
houses; where, when the walls are
plaistered with bad mortar, the calcarious
and nitrose salts sweat out
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>upon their surface, of a colour almost
as white as snow. The power of inspecting
their houses was invested in
the priests; who, when they observed
this foulness, gave orders first
to have the walls of the house scraped
all around; and afterwards, if it
continued to break out, to pull down
the house, and carry the materials
out of the city into an unclean place.</p>

<p>I am well aware, that all this is
related, as if God himself had struck
the house with this plague. But it is
well known, that that way of speaking
is not uncommon in the jewish
history; as in unexpected evils and
dreadful calamities, which are sometimes
said to be done by the hand of
God, tho&#8217; they may be produced by
natural causes. Nor can I be easily
induced to believe, with some divines,
that God, who commanded
his people to be always free from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
every sort of uncleanness, would
vouchsafe to work a miracle, in order
to inflict this most filthy punishment
on any person. Thus much is
indubitable, that the precepts of the
mosaic law were constituted particularly,
to avert the people from idolatry
and false religion, and at the same
time to keep them clear of all uncleanness.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
To this end conspired the
prohibition of eating blood, carrion,
or animals that died spontaneously,
swines flesh, and that of several other
creatures.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> For all these meats yield
a gross nutriment, which is improper
and prejudicial in diseases of the
skin.</p>

<p>But in order to close these theological
researches with somewhat medical,
I am convinced from experience,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>that there is not a better medicine
known against this filthy disease, than
the <i>tincture of Cantharides</i> of the
<i>London Dispensatory</i>. Its remarkable
virtue in this case, is owing to the
diuretic quality of these flies. For
there is a great harmony between the
kidneys and glands of the skin, so
that the humors brought on the latter,
easily find a way thro&#8217; the former,
and are carried off by urine:
and on the other hand, when the
kidneys have failed in the performance
of their functions, an urinous
humor sometimes perspires thro&#8217; the
cuticular pores. But such cathartics
are to be interposed at proper intervals,
as are most proper for evacuating
thick and acrid humors.</p>

<h3><i>The disease of king Saul.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hen</span> &#8220;King Saul was abandoned
by the Spirit of God,
and an evil spirit from the Lord
troubled him; his courtiers persuaded
him to command his servants
to seek out somebody that
was a good player on the harp,
who might sooth or compose him
by his music, when the evil spirit
from God was upon him.&#8221; Which
when Saul had done, by sending
messengers for David; &#8220;whenever
it happened that Saul was seized
with that evil spirit, David took
his harp, and play&#8217;d on it; and
thus Saul was refreshed and became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
composed, and the evil spirit
departed from<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now to me it appears manifest,
that this king&#8217;s disease was a true
madness, and of the melancholic or
atrabilarious kind, as the ancient
physicians called it. And the fits
return&#8217;d on him at uncertain periods,
as is frequently the case in this sort of
disease. Nor could the cause of that
disorder be a secret, seeing he had
been lately deprived of his kingdom
by God&#8217;s express command. Likewise
the remedy applied, to wit, playing
on the harp, was an extremely proper
one. For physicians have long
since taught us, that symphonies,
cymbals, and noises, were of service
towards dissipating melancholic
thoughts;<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> the power of which we
have accounted for in another place
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>upon geometrical principles.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> Hence
also it more plainly appears, that the
disorder was owing to natural causes;
for otherwise how could the music of
a harp drive it away? Counsel and
prudence in a man was, in the Hebrew
language, usually stiled the
Spirit of God; and a person deprived
of these qualities, was said to
be troubled with an evil spirit, that
is, to be mad.</p>

<p>I am not ignorant that the Jews, by
a manner of expression familiar among
them, are wont to describe diseases
of this kind, to the power of evil angels,
as ministers of God; and that
even at this day, some very learned
men defend the same notion. But for
my part, if I may be allowed to declare
my thoughts with freedom, I
cannot think it right to have recourse
to the divine wrath for diseases, which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>can be proved to have natural causes;
unless it be expresly declared, that
they were sent down directly from
heaven. For if they fall on us in
punishment of our sins, the intention
of the supreme lawgiver would
be frustrated, unless a sure rule was
given, whereby his vengeance might
be distinguished from common events;
in as much as the innocent
may be equal sharers in such calamities
with the guilty. Moreover, it
seems reasonable to believe, that evils
inflicted by the omnipotent judge,
must be either incurable, or curable
by himself alone; that the connection
of his power with his equity,
may the more brightly shine forth.
By such a criterion, are miraculous
works distinguished from the operations
of nature. For it would be impiety
to suppose, that the almighty
creator of heaven and earth intended,
that his works should be performed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
in vain. Wherefore it is worthy
of our observation, that great
care is always taken in the sacred histories,
to make the divine power in
such cases, appear most manifest to
all. Thus when the Lord had infected
Miriam (or Mary) with a leprosy,
for a sin committed by her,
and consented, on the supplication of
Moses, to make her whole; it was
not done till seven days afterward.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>
Gehazi&#8217;s leprosy remained in him
and his progeny for ever.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> King Azariah
was smote with the leprosy,
for not having demolished the high
places; and he was a leper unto the
day of his death.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> Ananias and his
wise were struck dead suddenly by
the miraculous power of St. Peter.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a>
Elymas the sorcerer, was struck blind
for a season by St. <i>Paul</i>, for his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>frauds and wickedness.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Therefore
since threats and plain indications of
diseases, inflicted in an uncommon
manner, are always manifestly declared;
whensoever these are wanting, why
may we not say, that the event was
by no means supernatural? And I
desire, once for all, that this sentiment
may hold good with regard to
several other calamities.</p>

<h3><i>The disease of king Jehoram.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>f</span> king Jehoram it is related,
that, &#8220;for his wicked life, the
Lord smote him in his bowels with
an incurable disease, so that he
voided his intestines daily for the
space of two years, and then died
of the violence of the<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> distemper.&#8221;
Two impious kings are recorded to
have had the same end, Antiochus
Epiphanes, and Agrippa; of whom
it was said: &#917;&#7984;&#962; &#964;&#7985; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#547; &#963;&#960;&#955;&#945;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<span class="i0">Of what avail are bowels to those<br /></span>

<p>Now this distemper seems to me
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>to be no other than a severe dysentery.
For in this the intestines are
ulcerated, and blood flows from the
eroded vessels, together with some
excrement, which is always liquid,
and slimy matter; and sometimes also
some fleshy strings come away, so
that the very intestines may seem to
be ejected.</p>

<h3><i>The disease of king Hezekiah.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;W</span>hen</span> Hezekiah lay sick of
a mortal disease, and the
prophet Isaiah went and declared
to him, by God&#8217;s express command,
that he should die and not
recover; the Lord moved by his
prayer, commanded Isaiah to return,
and tell him, that he would
cure him in three days. Whereupon
Isaiah ordered a <i>mass of figs</i>
to be taken, and laid it on the
boil; whereby he recovered<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Now to me it seems extremely
probable, that this king&#8217;s disease was
a fever, which terminated in an abscess:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>For in cases of this kind, those
things are always proper, which promote
suppuration; especially digestive
and resolving cataplasms; and
dried figs are excellent for this intention.
Thus, the Omnipotent, who
could remove this distemper by his
word alone, chose to do it by the effect
of natural remedies. And here we
have an useful lesson given us in adversities,
not to neglect the use of
those things, which the bountiful
Creator has bestowed on us, and at
the same time to add our fervent
prayers, that he would be graciously
pleased to prosper our endeavours.</p>

<h3><i>The disease of Old-age.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">O</span>ld-age</span> <i>itself is a disease</i>, as
the poet has properly expressed
it<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>. Wherefore as I have frequently
read with pleasure, the very elegant
description of it, given by Solomon
the wisest of kings; I think it will
not be foreign to my design, to attempt
an explanation and illustration
thereof. For it contains some things
not easy to be understood, because
the eloquent preacher thought proper
to express all the circumstances allegorically.
But first I will lay the
discourse itself before my readers,
which runs thus.</p>

<p>&#8220;Remember thy Creator in the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>days of thy youth, before the evil
times come, and the years draw
nigh, in which, thou shalt say, I
find no pleasure: before the sun,
and the light, and the moon, and
the stars be darkened, and the
clouds return after rain; when
the keepers of the house shall
tremble, and the soldiers shall
give way, and the diminished
grinders shall cease; and those
that look out thro&#8217; holes shall be
darkened; and the doors shall be
shut outwardly, with a low sound
of the mill, and they shall rise up
at the voice of the bird; and all
the daughters of music shall be of
no avail; also when they shall be
afraid of high places, and stumblings
in the way; and the almond
tree shall flower, and the <i>Cicad&aelig;</i>
shall come together; and the appetite
shall be lost, man departing
to his eternal habitation, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
mourners going about in the
street: before the silver chain be
broken asunder, and the golden
ewer be dashed in pieces; and the
pitcher be broken at the fountain
head; and the chariot be dashed
in pieces at the pit; and the dust
return to the earth, such as it had
been; and the Spirit return to
God, who gave it<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The recital of evils (and infirmities)
begins from the aberrations of
the mind. <i>The sun</i>, says Solomon,
<i>and the light, and the moon, and the
stars are darkened</i>. Perceptions of
the mind are less lively in old men;
the ideas and images of things are
confounded, and the memory decays:
whence the intellectual faculties
must necessarily lose their
strength or power by degrees. Wisdom
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>and understanding are frequently
called <i>light</i> in the sacred scriptures;<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
and privation of reason, <i>darkness</i>
and blindness.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Cicero likewise
says very justly, that <i>reason is as it
were, the light and splendor of life</i>.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Hence God is stiled the <i>father of
lights</i>.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Thus the virtues of the mind
decaying, may be compared to the
luminaries of the world overcast. I
am conscious that this exposition is
contrary to that of a number of
learned interpreters, who take this
<i>obscuration of the lights</i> in the genuine
sense of the words, and think that
the failing of the sight is here to be
understood. But I am surprized, how
they happened not to take notice,
that every thing in this discourse,
even to the most minute circumstances,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>is expressed in words bearing
a figurative sense. For whereas, in
describing the infirmities of Old-age,
the injuries of the operations of the
mind, as the most grievous of all,
were not to be pretermitted; so
these could not be more clearly expressed,
than by the obscuration of
the c&#339;lestial luminous bodies, which
rule our orb, and cause the vicissitudes
of times and seasons. Moreover
it is particularly to be observed here,
that the author mentions the defects
of sight lower down, and most certainly
he would have avoided repeating
the same thing.</p>

<p>But he goes on, and adds, what
well agrees with the foregoing explanation.
<i>The clouds return after rain.</i>
That is, cares and troubles crowd on
each other, and daily oppress aged
folks. As in moist climates, and
those liable to storms, even when the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
clouds seem to be exhausted, others
soon follow, and the rains become
almost perpetual. And these inconveniencies
are felt the more sensibly,
in proportion to the debilitation of
the powers of the mind, whereby
they are rendered less able now, than
formerly, either to bear, or get the
better of their oppressions.</p>

<p>But from the mind our royal author
now passes to the body. <i>The
keepers of the house</i>, says he, <i>shall
tremble, and the soldiers shall give
way, and the diminished grinders shall
cease</i>. The limbs, and firmest parts
of the body, are damaged by age:
the hands and knees grow weak,
thro&#8217; the relaxation of the nerves.
Hence those are rendered incapable
of defending us against injuries, and
of performing innumerable other good
offices, for which they were originally
intended; and these becoming unequal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to the weight they were wont
to sustain, lose their active suppleness,
and fail in bending. Likewise
the double teeth or grinders, either
drop out, or rot away; so as now to
be too few remaining to comminute
solid food. In the translation of the
Hebrew word, which I have here
rendered by <i>double teeth</i> or <i>grinders</i>,
I followed Arias Montanus, who, in
my opinion, has translated it right.
For it is in this passage used by the
author in the plural number; who
afterwards employs it in the singular,
but in a quite different sense, when
he treats of the sense of tasting; as I
shall shew anon, when I come to
that passage. For, that Solomon&#8217;s intention
in this place was, to describe
those defects of the senses, which generally
steal on old-age, I have not
the least doubt.</p>

<p>Wherefore now proceeding to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
them, he begins by the <i>sight</i>. <i>Those</i>,
says he, <i>that look thro&#8217; holes shall be
darkened</i>. By which words it is manifest,
that he points out the failing
of the eyes, which most people, far
advanced in years, feel by sad experience.</p>

<p>Next follows the <i>taste</i>, which he
thus describes: <i>The doors shall be shut
outwardly, with a low sound of the
mill</i>. As old people, thro&#8217; diminution
of appetite, open their mouths
seldomer than formerly; so for want
of teeth to comminute their food,
they do it with less noise. Now this
last inconvenience seems to be meant
and expressed very elegantly by the
words <i>a low sound of the mill</i>: for by
the word <i>mill</i>, which in the Hebrew
is used in the singular number, the
grinding of the food may very well
be meant; and this grinding, as it
is not done by the assistance of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
teeth, which they have lost, but by
that of the gums, is performed with
less noise.</p>

<p>Sleep is the sweet soother of our
labours, and the restorer of our exhausted
strength. But the loss of appetite,
and disgust to our food, generally
robs us of this comfort. Hence
subjoining this evil of old-age to the
foregoing, he says: <i>he shall rise up at
the voice of the bird</i>; that is, the old
man is awaked at the cock&#8217;s first
crowing. Wherefore his sleep is short
and interrupted, tho&#8217; his weakness
would require longer rest.</p>

<p>But he returns to the senses, among
which he gives the third place
to <i>hearing</i>; for receiving the benefits
of which the Creator gave us the
use of ears. Now this is frequently
diminished, and sometimes entirely
taken away in old-age; which the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
royal author seems to indicate in the
following words: <i>The daughters of
music shall be of no avail</i>. For thus he
thought proper to express the ears,
to which at this time of life, not
only the pleasure of harmonious
sounds is sought in vain; but, what
is much more disagreeable, the words
in conversation are not easily understood:
whereby the enjoyment, and
one of the greatest conveniencies of
life, are gradually lost. Hence in the
jewish history, Barzillai, at eighty
years of age, complains that he could
no longer <i>hear the voice of the singing
men and singing women</i>.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>These defects of the organs of
hearing, are immediately followed
by those of the sense of feeling. Now
<i>the touch</i>, as Cicero says, <i>is uniformly
spread over the whole body;
that we may feel all strokes and appulses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>of things</i>.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Wherefore this sense,
besides its other uses, contributes
vastly to the safety of the body, and
the removal of many evils, to which
it is perpetually exposed. And this
the sagacious author seems to have
principally in view, when he says:
<i>They shall be afraid of high places,
and stumblings in the way</i>. For as old
folks are unsure of foot, even in a
plain smooth way, by reason of the
weakness of their limbs; so when
they come to a rugged uneven road,
thro&#8217; the dulness of this sense, they
do not soon enough perceive the depressions
or elevations of the ground
whereby they run the hazard of stumbling
and hurting their feet. Therefore
they are not unjustly represented
as being <i>afraid</i>.</p>

<p>The only one that remains of the
senses is that of smelling, the diminution
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>of which in old men, he describes
with equal elegance and brevity
in this manner: <i>the almond tree
shall flower</i>. By which words he
seems to mean, that old people, as
if they lived in a perpetual winter, no
longer perceive the agreeable odors
exhaling from plants and flowers in
the spring and summer seasons. That
this tree flowers in winter, we learn
from Pliny, who in treating of it
says: <i>The almond tree flowers the first
of all trees, in the month of January</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
I am not to learn, that these words
are by most interpreters understood as
relating to grey hairs, which being
generally a sure token of old age,
they would have us believe, are denoted
by the white flowers of the almond
tree. But then, who can imagine,
that this wise author, after having
indicated the defects of four of the
senses, by clear and distinct marks,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>would designedly pass over the fifth
in silence? Besides, white hairs are
by no means to be esteemed a sure
and indubitable token of old-age;
since there are not a few to be found,
who turn gray in the middle stage of
life, before their bodily strength is
any ways impaired. Moreover, what
they say of the flowers of the almond
tree, does not seem to agree with
the things they mean by them: for
they are not, strictly speaking, white,
but of a purplish cast. Thus far
concerning the senses: let us proceed
to the remaining part.</p>

<p>The scrotal rupture is a disease
common to persons far advanced in
years; whether it be formed by the
intestine or omentum slipping down
into the scrotum, or proceed from a
humor distending that part. In either
case the part is tumefied. This pernicious
disease the Preacher thought<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
proper to compare to a grasshopper.
<i>The grasshopper</i>, says he, <i>shall be a
burthen, Oneri erit locusta</i>. For thus
the Hebrew phrase is more literally
translated, than by <i>convenient cicad&aelig;,
the cicad&aelig; shall come together</i>, as the
learned Castalio has rendered it. Indeed
the Vulgate version has <i>impinguabitur
locusta</i>, <i>the grasshopper shall
be fatted</i>. The Septuagint &#928;&#945;&#967;&#965;&#957;&#952;&#8134; &#7969; &#7936;&#967;&#961;&#8055;&#962;.
<i>The grasshopper shall be fatted.</i>
The Arabic version, turned into Latin,
<i>pinguescet locusta</i>, <i>The grasshopper
shall grow fat</i>. But our English
translation, <i>The grasshopper shall be
a burden</i>. It is well known, that the
Hebrew language is always modest,
and that the sacred Writers, in expressing
such things as belong to the
genital members, abstain from indecent
and obscene words, for fear of
offending chaste ears, and therefore
borrow similitudes from any other
things at discretion. Which is particularly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
observable in the <i>Canticum
Canticorum</i>, or <i>Solomon</i>&#8217;s <i>Song</i>, written
by our Author. Now the grasshopper,
or locust, is an odd-shaped
animal, made up chiefly of belly;
and therefore, especially when full of
eggs, may be said to bear some resemblance
to a scrotum, swoln by a
rupture.</p>

<p>These parts being thus affected,
the wise author adds, <i>the appetite
shall be lost</i>; wherein he does not
attend so much to the appetite for
victuals, as for those other things,
which are sought after in the vigor
of life. For as the author of <i>the
Art of Love</i> has rightly said: <i>Turpe
senilis amor</i><a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a>.</p>

<p>That old people are crushed to
death by so great a heap of evils and
infirmities, and <i>depart to their eternal
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>habitation</i>, to the grief of their
friends, can be no matter of wonder.
But in the remaining part of the
discourse we are admonished, that
their miseries in this life are not confined
within these bounds, but that
sometimes there is still an accession
of others.</p>

<p>For loss of strength in old age
does not terminate at the limbs, or
extremities of the body; the spine of
the back also loses considerably of its
firmness, by the daily diminution of
power in its muscles and ligaments:
hence an old man can seldom stand
upright, but stoops his body towards
the earth, which is shortly to cover
it. This part is likened to a <i>silver
chain</i>, which is said to be <i>broken
asunder</i>. For the <i>vertebr&aelig;</i>, of which
it is composed, may be looked upon as
the rings or links, and they give way
outward by the bending of the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
Moreover the <i>medulla oblongata</i>,
which passes through them, is of a
<i>silver</i> or whitish colour.</p>

<p>These points, which we have hitherto
handled, are very difficult of
explanation. But the three inconveniencies,
which close the discourse,
are true &aelig;nigma&#8217;s, and require an
Oedipus to solve them. And as such
an one, in my opinion, has not appeared
hitherto, I will use my endeavours
to do it. <i>The golden ewer</i>,
says he, <i>is dashed in pieces: the pitcher
is broken at the fountain-head;
and the chariot is dashed in pieces at
the pit</i>.</p>

<p>Old men are troubled with defluxions
from the head to the nose,
mouth and lungs; which are compared
to water rushing out of a
broken bottle or ewer. And the
ewer is said to be <i>of gold</i>, to express<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
the dignity of the head.</p>

<p>Nor does phlegm flow from the
head alone; but other parts also pour
forth their juices too abundantly or
irregularly. For the serosities, which
are secreted by the kidneys (whose
cavity is even at this day named pelvis
by Anatomists) runs into the bladder;
which, by reason of the relaxation
of its sphincter, as if the pitcher
were broken at the fountain head, is
not able to retain its contents a sufficient
time. Hence an incontinence
or dribbling of urine is continually
troublesome.</p>

<p>Now, the evils hitherto enumerated
lodge in particular parts; but
the last calamity, both in this discourse,
as well as in old people, is that
the whole body is afflicted. The very
course of the blood is interrupted;
hence wretched man is seized with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
difficulty of breathing, apoplexies or
lethargies. The heart also, the principle
and fountain of life, sinks thro&#8217;
want of its usual force, <i>and the broken
chariot falls into the pit</i>. The ancients
indeed did not know of the circulation
of the blood; but they could not
be ignorant, that it was moved thro&#8217;
the body, that it cherished the viscera
and members by its heat, and lastly,
that it concreted and grew cold in
death.</p>

<p>But nothing in this whole discourse
is so much worthy of our serious attention
as these words, with which he
closes it. <i>The dust returns to the earth,
such as it had been; and the spirit
returns to God, who gave it.</i> For by
these words his intention seems plainly
to have been, to refute the ignorant
notions of those, who thought that
the soul perished with the body, and
to assert its immortality.</p>

<h3><i>The disease of king Nebuchadnezzar.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hose</span> things, which are related
of Nebuchadnezzar king
of Babylon, appear so surprizing and
contrary to nature, that some interpreters
have imagined that he was
really transformed into a beast. For
&#8220;being driven from the company
of men for seven years, his dwelling
was with the beasts of the
field, he fed on grass as oxen;
his body was wetted with the dew
of heaven; his hair and nails were
grown like those of birds. At
length at the end of that space of
time, his understanding was restored
to him, and he was established
in his kingdom, and excellent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
majesty was added unto
him. Now his crime was pride
and the contempt of God<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>.&#8221;</p>

<p>All these circumstances agree so
perfectly well with hypochondriacal
madness, that to me it appears evident,
that Nebuchadnezzar was seized
with this distemper, and under its
influence ran wild into the fields:
and that, fancying himself transformed
into an ox, he fed on grass
in the manner of cattle. For every
sort of madness is, as I shall specify
more particularly hereafter<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a>, a disease
of a disturbed imagination;
which this unhappy man laboured
under full seven years. And thro&#8217;
neglect of taking proper care of himself,
his hair and nails grew to an
excessive length; whereby the latter
growing thicker and crooked, resembled
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>the claws of birds. Now,
the ancients called persons affected
with this species of madness &#955;&#965;&#954;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;
or &#954;&#965;&#957;&#945;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#8061;&#960;&#959;&#953;; because they
went abroad in the night, imitating
wolves or dogs; particularly intent
upon opening the sepulchres of the
dead, and had their legs much ulcerated
either by frequent falls, or
the bites of<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> dogs. In like manner
are the daughters of Proetus related
to have been mad, who, as Virgil
says,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;<i>Implerunt falsis mugitibus agros.</i><a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;With mimick&#8217;d mooings fill&#8217;d the fields.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="noindent">For, as Servius observes, Juno possessed
their minds with such a species
of madness, that fancying themselves
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>cows, they ran into the fields, bellowed
often, and dreaded the plough.
But these, according to Ovid, the
physician Melampus,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">&mdash;<i>per carmen &amp; herbas</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Eripuit furiis.</i><a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Snatch&#8217;d from the furies by his charms<br /></span>
<span class="i2">and herbs.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Nor was this disorder unknown
to the moderns; for Schenckius records
a remarkable instance of it in
a husbandman of Padua, <i>who imagining
that he was a wolf, attack&#8217;d,
and even killed several persons in the
fields; and when at length he was
taken, he persevered in declaring himself
a real wolf, and that the only
difference consisted in the inversion of
his skin and hair</i><a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a>.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p><p>But it may be objected to our
opinion, that this misfortune was foretold
to the king, so that he might
have prevented it by correcting his
morals; and therefore it is not probable
that it befel him in the course
of nature. But we know, that those
things, which God executes either
thro&#8217; clemency or vengeance, are frequently
performed by the assistance
of natural causes. Thus having
threatened Hezekiah with death, and
being afterwards moved by his prayers,
he restored him to life, and made use
of figs laid on the tumor, as a medicine
for his<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> disease. He ordered
king Herod, upon account of his
pride, to be devoured by worms<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>.
And no body doubts but that the
plague, which is generally attributed
to the divine wrath, most commonly
owes its origin to corrupted air.</p>

<h3><i>The Palsy.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>here</span> are three paralytics recorded
in the holy gospels to
have been cured by Jesus Christ<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>.
The case of one of these, which is
the third, having some singularities
in it, I shall relate the particulars of
it in the words of St. John, &#8220;There
is (says the Evangelist) at Jerusalem,
by the sheep market, a pool, near
which lay a great multitude of
impotent folk, blind, halt, and withered,
waiting for the moving of
the water. For an angel went
down at a certain season into the
pool, and troubled the water:
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>whosoever then first after the troubling
of the water stepped in, was
made whole of whatsoever disease
he had. And a certain man was
there, who had an infirmity thirty
and eight years. When Jesus saw
him lie, and knew that he had
been now a long time <i>in that case</i>,
he saith unto him, <i>Wilt thou be
made whole</i>? The impotent man
answered him, <i>Sir, I have no
man, when the water is troubled,
to put me into the pool; but while
I am coming, another steppeth
down before me</i>. Jesus saith unto
him: <i>Rise, take up thy bed, and
walk</i>. And immediately the man
was made whole, and took up
his bed, and walked.&#8221;</p>

<p>This pool, or at least some other
in its stead, is shewn to travellers
even at this day by the friars who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
reside there.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> But, what is much
more to the purpose, Eusebius asserts
that it actually existed in his
time, and had two basons; both of
which were filled every year by the
rains, at a stated time; and the water
of one of them was of a surprizing
red colour:<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> which last ph&#339;nomenon
he attributes, according to
the vulgar opinion, to the sacrifices,
which were formerly cleansed there.
But I am clearly of opinion, that it
was owing to a red earth or ocre,
which is frequently found in baths,
raised up from the bottom at certain
times by the rains, and mixing with
the water.</p>

<p>Commentators find more than
one difficulty here. For first they
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>enquire what sort of water this was;
next why it could not exert its virtue
without being troubled; then what
was the nature of this troubling; and
lastly, concerning the angel they do
not agree, who he was. Wherefore
I will offer my opinion, in a concise
manner, on these several points.</p>

<p>First then, mineral waters were
in high esteem among the ancients
for many diseases: they used them
inwardly and outwardly, and recommended
them for different distempers
according to the nature of the
mineral, with which they were impregnated.
Thus in paralitic cases,
Celsus recommends <i>swimming or
bathing in the natural sea or salt
water, where it can conveniently be
come at; where it cannot, even in
water made salt by art</i>.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> And Pliny
says, <i>sulphureous water is useful for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>the nerves, aluminous for paralytics,
or other relaxed habits of the body</i>.
He likewise adds; <i>They use the mud
of those fountains with advantage,
especially if, when it is rubbed on, it
be suffered to dry in the sun</i>.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> The
same author relates strange things of
some springs. <i>In Bo&aelig;tia</i>, says he,
<i>there are two springs, one of which
retrieves the memory, the other destroys
it.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> In Macedonia two streams
meet, one of them extremely wholsome
to drink, the other mortal.</i><a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> And other
things of the same nature. To
these may be added what Lucian, an
eye-witness relates of the river Adonis
in the country of the Byblii. <i>The water
of that river changes its colour once
a year, and turning as red as blood,
gives a purple tinge to the sea, into
which it runs</i>: and the cause of this
ph&#339;nomenon he ascribes to its <i>passing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>thro&#8217; mount Libanus, whose earth is
red</i>.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Nor is it foreign to the purpose
to observe, that there are wonderful
eruptions of water in some countries.
In the province of Conaught in Ireland,
there is a fountain of fresh water
on the top of a high mountain,
which imitates the tide, by sinking
and overflowing twice a day.<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> A certain
spring in Hungary in the county
of Saros, is under the influence of the
moon: since it is well known to increase
with the moon&#8217;s increase, to
diminish with its decrease, and to
run quite dry at the great change or
new moon.<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> In fine, medicinal waters
were not uncommon in Palestine,
the accounts of which are collected
by that great master of oriental
literature, Hadrian Reland.<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p><p>Nevertheless those who contend
for a miracle in this place, say
that there are no baths known, which
can cure all distempers; nor any
that retain their virtue but one single
month in the year: they likewise add,
that it was the action of the angel
troubling this water, that gave it its
sanative qualities. Those who are of
a different sentiment, enumerate a
number of waters, which become salutary
at certain times of the year,
by being then charged with metallic
salts; the mud of which being brought
up from the bottom, has been serviceable
in many diseases. Wherefore
they say, it is not just to have recourse
to a supernatural power for
effects, which may be produced by
the ordinary course of nature. But as
far as I am able to judge of these contradictory
opinions, a middle way between
them seems to me to come
nearest the truth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>For my notion of the matter is,
that the water of this pool acquired
its medicinal virtues from the mud
settled at the bottom, which was
charged with metallic salts, perhaps
from sulphur, allum, or nitre. And
whenever it happened that the water
was troubled by any natural cause
whatsoever, perhaps a subterraneous
heat, or rains; these salts were raised
up and mixed with it, and might
well be beneficial to those, who went
down into the pool, before the metallic
particles subsided. Wherefore
it is no wonder, that there <i>lay</i>, in
the porches of this bath, which the
evangelist says were five in number, <i>a
great multitude of impotent folk waiting
for the moving of the water</i>; and
especially of such as laboured under
those diseases, for which it was serviceable,
as blindness, palsies, and
decays. And it was very natural for
every individual person to endeavour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to get into it as soon as possible;
for fear of being frustrated of their
cure by the subsidence of the mud.
Wherefore <i>he who first stept in</i>, experienced
the virtue of the water.</p>

<p>The next circumstance to be observed
is, that the fact here related,
happened when <i>there was a feast of
the jews</i>, that is, the pentecost. And
we learn from Eusebius, that this
method of curing prevailed but once
in a year.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> But it is well known
that this feast was celebrated in the
month of May or beginning of June:
which is a very proper season for the
virtues of medicinal waters. Upon
which account the patients flock&#8217;d
thither the more eagerly, that they
might catch a medicine, which they
could make use of but once a year.</p>

<p>Lastly, with relation to the angel,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>who is said <i>to have</i> troubled the
water at a certain season; those who
contend for a miracle, attribute the
sanative quality of the pool to him.
But we have already taken notice,
that whenever any thing uncommon
or surprizing happened, of which the
jews could not investigate the cause,
they were accustomed to say, it was
done <i>by the angel of the Lord</i>. Yet it
is possible, that God might have added
this miraculous circumstance to
natural effects, that this pool should
be sanative, at one certain time of
the year only, and that too, when
the whole nation were assembled to
celebrate their solemn festival; and
to him only, who first went into it.
The reason of which proceeding (if it
be allowed to form a conjecture on
the divine counsels) might perhaps
have been, that God was pleased to
testify by so manifest a sign, that he
would not, as he had promised, entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
abandon his chosen people;
before the coming of the Messias.</p>

<p>Wherefore upon the whole, this
salutary virtue of the water, which
might be medicinal by nature, seems
to be so regulated by God, as at the
same time to afford the jews a token
of his presence. But the power of
Christ, administered to this infirm
man, a more noble remedy than that
water, his <i>evil-chasing</i><a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> word. And
this power was the more seasonable
in this case, because the disease was
of so many years standing, that it
could not be removed by a natural
remedy: whence his divine virtue
shone forth the more brightly.</p>

<h3><i>Of Demoniacs.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hat</span> the D&aelig;moniacs, &#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#953;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;,
mentioned in the gospels,
laboured under a disease really natural,
tho&#8217; of an obstinate and difficult
kind, appears to me very probable
from the accounts given of them.
They were indeed affected various
ways. For sometimes, they rent their
garments, and ran about naked;
striking terror into all those whom
they met, and even wounding their
own bodies; so very furious, that
tho&#8217; bound with chains and fetters,
they broke their bonds, and rambled
in the most lonely places, and among
the sepulchres of the dead. Sometimes
also they cried out, that they
were possessed by many devils, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
they imagined could pass out of themselves
into other bodies.<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> At other
times, either they were worried, and
made a hideous noise;<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> or were
thrown on the ground, without being
hurt, and the devil went out of
them.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>These are all actions of madmen;
but the dispute is, whether they were
wrought by devils, or by the violence
of the disease. Thus much is certain,
that in those times it was a common
opinion among the jews, that evil
spirits frequently took possession of
people, and tortured them in so surprizing
a manner, as if they were agitated
by furies. For in the whole catalogue
of diseases, which afflict mankind,
there is no other, that seems
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>so much to surpass the force of nature,
as this, in wretchedly tormenting
the patient by fierce distractions
of the mind, and excessively strong,
tho&#8217; involuntary, motions of the body.
But most certainly we find nothing
sacred in all this, nothing but
what may arise from a natural indisposition
of body. And in order to
place this my opinion in the stronger
light, it may not be improper to give
a short discourse on madness; not indeed
on that species, which comes on
in an acute fever, and goes off with
it, which is called a phrenzy, and is
always of short duration; but that
other sort, which is rivetted in the
body, and constitutes a chronical
disease.</p>

<p>Wherefore all madness is a disease
of an injured imagination, which
derives its origin from the mind, having
been too long a time fixed on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
any one object. Hence proceed uneasiness
and anxieties of mind concerning
the event. And by how much
the things, whose images incessantly
occur to the imagination, are of
greater moment in life, the more
violently they disturb the person;
examples of which we see particularly
in love and religion, wherein
hope, fear, despair, and other contrary
passions, succeeding each other
by turns, drag the person different
ways. That this is the case, will not
be doubted by any one, who recollects,
that a madman often has a
good memory; manages his affairs,
except when some vain ideas come
across his mind, with tolerable prudence,
nay sometimes with more
than ordinary cunning; and that he
ofttimes recovers the intire and permanent
use of his reason, by a course
of proper medicines. Therefore in
this disorder the person is first over-whelmed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
by terrifying ideas, which
are followed by wrath and fury, as
attendants on anxiety: whence he
threatens and attempts to do acts of
the utmost cruelty to those who approach
him, and thro&#8217; excess of anguish,
frequently lays violent hands
even on himself: then he grows again
melancholic; and thus rage
and dejection of spirits affect him alternately:
moreover it is no uncommon
thing to see a person under these
circumstances, especially when the
disease has taken deep root by length
of time, seeking unfrequented and
solitary places, in order to avoid the
conversation of his fellow creatures,</p>

<p>Now, people afflicted with this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
disorder, often live a long time. For
all mad folks in general bear hunger,
cold, and any other inclemency of
the weather; in short, all bodily inconveniencies,
with surprizing ease;
as they enjoy a strength of constitution
superior to what might be easily
imagined. Likewise it frequently happens,
that an epilepsy comes on madness
of a long standing. For these
diseases are nearly related; and in
this case, we know by experience,
that there remain not the least hopes
of recovery. Lastly it is to be observed,
that the patient is either frantic
or melancholic, according as his
habit of body is disposed to receive
this or that injury.</p>

<p>But that the casting out of devils,
is nothing more than the removal of
madness, many do not believe, upon
this account, that those things which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
happen to persons thus affected, seem
to them impossible to be done by the
force of nature. But certainly these
gentlemen are too much strangers to
physic, and have not sufficiently attended
to ph&#339;nomena no less surprizing,
which daily occur in other
diseases. Do we not often see that
violent affections of the mind are the
cause of death? A sudden fright has
destroyed many, and even excessive
joy has been fatal. A dangerous distemper
sometimes passes from one
part of the body to another, in the
twinkling of an eye. The venom
thrown into the mass of blood by the
bite of a mad dog, generally lies still
a good while; and at the end of some
weeks, sometimes months, exerting
its strength, it produces symptoms
not inferior to those, which are said
to be produced by devils. What is
more surprizing than some things
which fall out in pregnancies? If a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
pregnant woman happens to have an
eager desire for any thing, and is
disappointed, she sometimes marks
the f&#339;tus with the figure or likeness
of the object longed for, on this or
that part of the body. And, what is
still more, and approaches to a prodigy,
upon the mother being terrified
by a sudden injury done to any
one part, that very part in the child
suffers the same evil, and decays for
want of nourishment. I know that
the truth of stories of this kind, is
called in doubt by some physicians;
because they cannot conceive, how
such things can happen. But many
examples, of which I have been an
eye-witness, have freed my mind of
all scruples on this head. Now, the
power of the imaginative faculty is so
stupendous, that the mind is not less
affected by false, than by true images,
when daily subjected to them. This
we find by experience in those women,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
who are called witches, who,
being under the influence of such an
error of the mind, frequently imagine
that they not only converse with
devils, but also have enter&#8217;d into
compacts with them; and persist in
these notions with such obstinacy,
that, when they are brought to a
trial, they confess themselves guilty
of wickednesses, which they never
perpetrated, though they know that
they must suffer death for their confession.
Moreover, every body knows
how wonderfully the mind is disturbed
in melancholies. One of
them thinks his head is made of
glass, and is afraid of stirring abroad,
for fear of having it broken: another
believes himself to be actually
dead, and refuses food, because the
dead ought not to eat. There are
a thousand stories of this kind. I
remember, a man of letters, with
whom I was well acquainted, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
positively asserted that he was big
with child, and was vastly anxious
for a happy delivery. I saw two others,
who, when alone, fancied they
heard the words of people whispering
them in the ear. Nor is their
case different, in my opinion, who
persuade themselves that they see
ghosts and hobgoblins. For deliriums
are a kind of dreams of people awake;
and the mind in both cases
affects the body differently, according
to the nature of its objects.</p>

<p>From what we have said, it manifestly
appears, how many different
ways the lessons of imagination, when
they are confirm&#8217;d by long habit, are
capable of affecting a man, and entirely
ruining his whole frame. But
every body knows, that the human
mind is disturbed by nothing more
than by fear; the cause of which is
self-love ingrafted in all men. Whereas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
then, as Cicero very justly observes,
<i>there is no nation so savage,
no man so rude, as not to have some
notion of the gods</i>;<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> it is no wonder,
that men conscious of wicked deeds,
should be struck with the fear of
God, whose empire over all created
things they acknowledged. For, as
they attributed every good thing, every
benefit of this life, to the gods;
so they were of opinion, that evils
and calamities were sent down by
them in punishment of crimes. Now,
idolatry, as I said above,<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> had its origin
among the Chaldeans; and at
first it consisted in the worship of
the sun and moon, but afterwards it
was extended to the adoration of d&aelig;mons.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
But these were believed to be
divine ministers; and that they were
originally the souls of heroes and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>great men, who were worshipped for
services done to mankind in general,
or to their native country in particular.
And this d&aelig;moniac religion being
propagated from the Chald&aelig;ans
to the Ph&#339;nicians, then to the Egyptians,
came afterwards to the
Greeks, thence to the Romans, and
in progress of time to the other nations.</p>

<p>But the jews, accustomed to ascribe
every uncommon or wonderful work
of nature to the agency of angels, as
ministers of the supreme deity, could
easily work up their minds to believe,
that some dreadful diseases, which
injured the mind and body together,
the causes whereof they could not investigate,
arose from the operation of
evil angels. For we learn from Philo
Jud&aelig;us,<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> with whom Josephus also
agrees in opinion, <i>that they believed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>there were bad as well as good
angels; that the good executed the
commands of God on men, that they
were irreprehensible and beneficent;
but the bad execrable, and every way
mischievous</i>.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a> But a more illustrious
example of this matter cannot be
given, than in the narrative of Saul&#8217;s
disease,<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> of which I have already
treated.<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Nor were madness and the
epilepsy the only diseases, which they
imputed to devils. When Jesus had
restored speech to the <i>furious dumb
man</i>, he is said to have done it by
<i>casting out a devil</i>.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> And when he
had cured another furious person,
who was <i>blind and dumb</i>, the pharisees
reproached him <i>with casting out
devils by beelzebub the prince of the
devils</i>.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> In fine, Christ himself uses
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>this common way of expression, on
occasion of the <i>woman which had a
spirit of infirmity eighteen years,
whom he freed from that infirmity</i>;
by saying, that <i>satan had held her
bound these eighteen years</i>.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>And this custom of taking madmen
for demoniacs, was not so peculiar
to the jews, but that it prevailed
in other nations also. Hence
in Herodotus king Cleomenes is said
to be driven into madness, not by
any d&aelig;mon, but by a habit of drunkenness,
which he had contracted among
the Scythians, whereby he became
frantic.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> And whereas &#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8119;&#957;
signifies the same thing as &#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#8057;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7956;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#957;,
Xenophon uses this word for <i>furere</i>,
to be raging mad or furious.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> Moreover
Aristophanes, intending to express
a high degree of the same disease,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>employs the word &#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8119;&#957;,
and calls the highest degree of madness,
not &#956;&#945;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&#957;, but &#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#948;&#945;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#957;&#8055;&#945;&#957;<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>.
Hence also, as Aret&aelig;us observes, this
disease was called <i>morbus sacer</i>, or
the sacred disease, <i>because it was imagined
that some d&aelig;mon had entered
into the man</i>.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> Wherefore the physicians
found it absolutely necessary to
oppose this false notion with all their
might. Because the people were generally
persuaded, that diseases, which
they believed to be caused by evil spirits,
were to be expelled, not by medical
skill, but by religious rites and
ceremonies. Upon this account the
prince of physicians Hippocrates, or
at least some one of his scholars, wrote
a very useful piece,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> wherein he asserts
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>that no diseases are inflicted on
man, immediately, by any divine
power; and that those persons ought
to be accounted magicians and jugglers,
who cover their ignorance with
a veil of sanctity, by infusing such
notions into the minds of the people.</p>

<p>But with regard to this power of
the devils over human bodies, believed
equally by the jews and other
nations, I have already said, that the
divinity ought not to be made a party
concerned in imposing diseases, which
may possibly have natural causes; unless
it be expresly declared, that they
were inflicted immediately by the
hand of God.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> For of all the diseases,
with which miserable mortals
are tormented, there are none so
wonderful and dreadful to appearance,
but may be the natural consequences
of bodily indispositions.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>Wherefore God himself, if he thinks
proper, can employ either natural
causes, or the ministry of good angels,
to inflict all sorts of diseases on
mankind. And I hope nobody will
believe, that the devils have had the
power granted them of torturing men
at their wanton pleasure. But to say
more on this subject seems the less
necessary; because two very learned
divines of our nation have already
treated it in a full and ample manner.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a></p>

<p>Therefore in order to put an
end to these demoniacal diseases, I
will now briefly shew, how they are
to be treated. And first of all, particular
care should be taken, to
keep the patient&#8217;s mind employed in
thoughts directly contrary to those,
which possessed it before: for one set
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>of ideas gives place to another, and
by effecting this change, the mind is
brought out of the state in which it
was: a circumstance, to which the
generality of physicians do not give
sufficient attention. When this can
be brought about, the disease is sometimes
speedily cured. But when either
the long standing of the distemper,
or some other cause, renders
this total change impracticable; at
least the strength of the present set
of ideas ought to be diminished and
destroyed by all possible means. The
vain fears of some are to be diverted,
and their dismal thoughts dispelled.
The daring ferocity of others is to be
curb&#8217;d; for which end it is often
necessary, to use hard words and
threats. Likewise sudden frights,
which may give the mind a different
commotion, from that which before
disturbed it, have been found to afford
a temporary relief at least. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
ancients prescribed some corrections,
such as bindings and stripes.<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> And indeed
it is sometimes necessary to bind
those, who are too unruly; to prevent
their doing mischief to themselves or
others. But there is the less necessity
for torments and stripes, because
all mad men are of such a cowardly
disposition; that even the most
frantic and mischievous, after being
once or twice tied, surrender at discretion,
and thence forward refrain
from committing any outrage, thro&#8217;
fear of the punishment.</p>

<p>As to the medical part, the gross
humors of the body are to be thinned,
and the disorderly motion of
the animal spirits is to be calmed.
For which end blood-lettings, emetics,
cathartics, blisters, and setons,
also sometimes coolings of the head
are to be employed. To these the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>f&#339;tid gums are to be added, especially
<i>assa f&#339;tida</i>, <i>myrrh</i>, and <i>galbanum</i>.
And <i>camphire</i> has been frequently
found serviceable in excessive
ferocity and want of sleep. But
when the disease is accompanied by a
fever, nothing is more proper than
nitre, given in as large quantities as
the stomach will bear. Lastly, the
patient is to be kept to a slender
diet, and compelled to use exercise.
But in all evacuations, a certain degree
of moderation ought to be used,
lest the madness be changed into a
contrary disease, which the ancients
termed <i>morbus cardaicus</i>,<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> that is, an
excessive weakness of body. In which
case, the patient is so far exhausted,
that medicines are of no avail; but
the miserable dejected man drags the
remains of life, alass! generally too
long.</p>

<h3><i>Of Lunatics.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> some ancient physicians attributed
the falling sickness to
some divine power, so they ascribed
madness to the influence of the moon.
Yet the lunatic, &#963;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#950;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;, whose
disease is described in the gospels,
was affected with the falling sickness.<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
Wherefore this patient (for
there is but one of this kind expresly
recorded there) was either mad and
epileptic at the same time, which is
not uncommon; or he laboured under
a periodical epilepsy, returning
with the changes of the moon, which
is a very common case. For the account
given of him is very short, that
<i>he ofttimes fell into the fire and oft
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>into the water</i>. Now in this distemper
a person falls down suddenly, and
lies for some time as dead; or by a
general convulsion of his nerves, his
body is agitated, with distorted eyes,
and he foams at the mouth. But at
length he recovers out of the fit, and
has no more knowledge or remembrance
of it, than if nothing had
happened to him. Yet <i>Jesus</i> is said
to have <i>rebuked the devil, and he departed
out of him, and the child was
cured</i>. That this child&#8217;s case was epileptic,
appears more manifestly from
the account given of it by the evangelist,
who was also a physician: for
he says, <i>that as soon as the spirit has
seized the patient, he cries out, foams
at the mouth, and is torn and worried
by him</i>.<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a></p>

<p>Now, as to these &#963;&#949;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#953;&#945;&#950;&#959;&#956;&#8051;&#957;&#959;&#953;, who
are subjoined to the demoniacs, as if
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>their diseases were different, and
whom Jesus is said to have cured;<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
they were either mad, or mad and
epileptic together, which is not an
uncommon case, as we have just now
said. And as to devils, we have
treated of them sufficiently. But with
relation to the moon, there is not the
least reason to doubt, but that the
regular returns of the paroxysms at
certain times of the month, gave occasion
to men to believe, that this
disease was lunar. For that planet
has such a real influence on this disease,
that it frequently happens to
some patients, never to be seized
with the fit but about the new and
full moon; which seems to join its
energy to those causes, that are adapted
to produce this evil. But the
manner of accounting for this I have
delivered in another place; where I
have plainly shewn that our atmosphere
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>has its tides as well as the
sea.<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>And indeed the great Hippocrates
has long since taught, that this disease
is owing to natural causes, and
consequently, by no means divine.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
For altho&#8217; in his time, neither the
inward parts of the animal body, nor
the properties of the blood and humors,
especially of the nervous fluid,
were sufficiently known; yet by his
great sagacity and experience, he has
left us several useful observations, in
relation both to the nature of the
disease, and to its cure. For he has
shewn, that it arises from too great
a quantity of humors in the brain;
and therefore that the best method of
cure is to dry up, and lessen the
quantity of this peccant matter; without
having recourse to incantations
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>and juggling tricks, so much in use
in those days.</p>

<p>But when in succeeding ages, the
use of medicines became more common,
a great number of remedies for
this dreadful disease were invented,
some of which indeed were too filthy
and shocking: such as drinking the
warm blood of a gladiator just slain;
eating human or horse&#8217;s flesh, the testicles
and penis of some animals, and
other things of the same kind;<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> as if
matters so repugnant to nature, could
be contrary to such grievous defects
of it. For so it often happens, that
when a rational medicine is not to be
found, any improper and rash one is
attempted. But such experiments are
to be abandoned to itinerant quacks,
and credulous old women. Though
even in our days our art is not sufficiently
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>purged of this filth in these
cases; seeing the dung of some birds,
and the hoofs of quadrupeds are still
ordered to be swallowed down by the
sick. But whereas chemistry has furnished
us with the means of extracting
the salts, and other most active
principles from bodies; to me it is
matter of admiration, why physicians
do not choose to order these
principles to be taken pure into the
body, rather than the coarse and f&#339;culant
substances, that contain them;
which are always disagreeable, and
sometimes hurtful also, to the stomach.
But this most difficult distemper
demands helps far superior
to these; nor will any one method
of cure answer in all cases, but the
course must be altered according to
the difference of constitution, &amp;c.
However, I will here propose those
things, which have been found to be
most generally serviceable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>

<p>Blood is to be taken away several
times, according to the strength
of the patient, in order to check its
impetus. Vomits are to be administered
now and then, but cathartics
more frequently. It is particularly
requisite to draw the redundant
humor from the head, which
is done by blisters; but better, by
applying a caustic near the occiput,
and making an issue, which is to be
kept constantly running.</p>

<p>These remedies contribute indeed
to weaken the paroxysms; but
for removing the cause, when it can
be done (for sometimes it cannot)
other helps are requisite. For it is
manifest, that the cause lies chiefly
in the nervous fluid, commonly called
animal spirits. But to investigate
the manner how this fluid is
affected in diseases of this kind,
would, in my opinion, be a fruitless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
labour. However, as I have
shewn on another occasion,<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> that
it consists of very minute particles
secreted from the blood in the brain,
and receives and imprisons a considerable
quantity of that elastic
matter, universally diffused throughout
all nature; it cannot be doubted,
but that it may be so corrupted
by some indisposition of the body
or mind, as to become more or less
improper for executing the functions
of life, and perform all animal motions,
not at the command of the
will, but in a disorderly manner, and
with a certain ungovernable impetuosity.
Now the best remedies for
correcting this depraved condition of
the animal spirits, are chiefly those,
which have the most powerful faculties
of attenuating the humors,
and throwing them out of the body
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>by sweat. Of these the most excellent
are the <i>Root of wild Valerian</i>,
<i>Russian Castor</i>, <i>the f&#339;tid
Gums</i>, and <i>Native Cinnabar</i>, taken
daily in pretty large quantities; with
the interposition of cathartics at proper
intervals, among which there is
none better than the <i>Tinctura sacra</i>.
I have long known by experience,
that the celebrated <i>Misleto of the
Oak</i>, is an useless weed. And indeed
how can it be otherwise, since
it has scarcely any taste or smell,
and is entirely indebted to the religion
of the Druids for its great
character. Wherefore it is to be
rank&#8217;d with those other frivolous
things, which superstition has introduced
into physick; unless a person
can work himself up into a
belief, that the golden sickle, with
which it was cut down, the priest&#8217;s
snow-white garment, the sacrifice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
of white bulls, and other such trifling
circumstances, are conducive
towards a cure.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<h3><i>The issue of blood in a woman.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>aint</span> Matthew relates, that
&#8220;Christ, by his word alone,
cured a woman who had been
diseased with an issue of blood for
twelve<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> years.&#8221;</p>

<p>And here arises a question, concerning
the nature of this disease.
But as the words in the Greek are
&#947;&#965;&#957;&#8052; &#7937;&#953;&#956;&#959;&#8164;&#8165;&#959;&#547;&#963;&#945;, I am of opinion, that
it was a flux of blood from the natural
parts, which Hippocrates<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> calls
&#8165;&#8057;&#959;&#957; &#7937;&#7985;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#8061;&#948;&#951;, and observes, that it is
necessarily tedious. Wherefore having
been exhausted by it for twelve years,
may justly be said to be incurable by
human art.</p>

<h3><i>Weakness of the back, with a rigidity
of the back-bone.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">&#8220;T</span>here</span> was a woman which
had a spirit of infirmity
eighteen years, and was so bowed
together, that she could in no
wise lift up herself, and Jesus laid
his hands on her, and she was
freed from her infirmity, and immediately
made<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> strait.&#8221;</p>

<p>This woman was &#963;&#965;&#947;&#954;&#8059;&#960;&#964;&#547;&#963;&#945;, that
is, <i>stooping forward</i>; being unable
&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#954;&#8059;&#968;&#945;&#953;, or <i>to lift up her head</i>. Now
that spirit, according to the common
way of speaking of the jews, was
satan. For thus Christ himself, answering
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>the ruler of the synagogue,
who was angry that the woman had
been cured on the sabbath day, says,
that <i>satan had held her bound these
eighteen years</i>. And exactly in the
same sense saint Mark employs &#960;&#957;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#945; &#7940;&#955;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#957;
for a <i>spirit, which obstructed
the faculty of speech</i>.<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<p>This infirmity often befalls those,
who have been very long afflicted
with a disorder of the loins: whence
the muscular fibres of that part become
contracted and rigid. Wherefore
it is very probable, that this tedious
disease proceeded from that
very cause, and was curable by the
divine assistance only.</p>

<h3><i>The bloody sweat of Christ.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">S</span>aint</span> Luke relates of Christ
himself, that, &#8220;when he was
in an agony by the fervency of
his prayers, his sweat was like
drops of blood falling down on
the<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> ground.&#8221;</p>

<p>This passage is generally understood,
as if the Saviour of mankind
had sweated real blood. But the
text does not say so much. The
sweat was only &#8033;&#963;&#949;&#8055; &#977;&#961;&#8057;&#956;&#946;&#959;&#953; &#7937;&#8055;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#959;&#962;, as it
were, or like drops of blood; that
is, the drops of sweat were so large,
thick and viscid, that they trickled
to the ground like drops of blood.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>Thus were the words understood by
Justin Martyr, Theophylactus and
Euthymius. And yet Galen has
observed, that <i>it sometimes happens,
that the pores are so vastly dilated
by a copious and fervid spirit; that
even blood issues thro&#8217; them, and constitutes
a bloody sweat</i>.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<h3><i>The disease of Judas.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> the number of diseases, I rank
the death of Judas, the wicked
betrayer of Christ; of which I shall
treat the more willingly, because
very learned interpreters of the holy
scriptures have run into different opinions
concerning it. And about fifty
years ago, two famous professors of
history in the university of Leyden,
Jacobus Gronovius and Jacobus Perizonius,
handled this controversy in
print with too much passion. For polite
literature does not always polish
its admirers.</p>

<p>The origin of the dispute was this.
Perizonius had published &AElig;lian&#8217;s vari&aelig;
histori&aelig;, with his own notes and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
those of others; where taking occasion
from what &AElig;lian says of Poliager,<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a>
he diligently examines the signification
of the verb &#7937;&#960;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;, which
saint Matthew<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> employs in relating
the death of Judas; and insists that
that word does not only mean strangling
with a halter, but also sometimes
excessive grief, by which a
person is brought to the brink of
death, and frequently even destroys
himself. This criticism was taken amiss
by Gronovius, who had already
published a book <i>de morte Jud&aelig;</i>,
wherein he had said that the wretch
had voluntarily put an end to his
life by a halter; wherefore he drew
his pen, in order to refute his adversary&#8217;s
reasonings, and corroborate his
own. Moreover he quarrels with Perizonius
about the phrase &#960;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;,
which he positively affirms ought to
be understood not of a dying man,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>but solely of one actually dead, or of
a dead body cast or tumbled down.
For St. Matthew simply says &#7936;&#960;&#8053;&#947;&#958;&#945;&#964;&#959;,<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a>
but St. Luke more fully, &#960;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;
&#7952;&#955;&#8049;&#954;&#951;&#963;&#949; &#956;&#8051;&#963;&#959;&#962;, &#954;&#945;&#953; &#7952;&#958;&#949;&#967;&#8059;&#952;&#951; &#960;&#8049;&#957;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#8048; &#963;&#960;&#955;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#957;&#945; &#7936;&#965;&#964;&#547;,<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
that is, <i>falling headlong,
he burst asunder in the midst, and all
his bowels gushed out</i>. Wherefore, if
the verb &#7936;&#960;&#8049;&#947;&#967;&#949;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953; can bear no other
signification than that <i>strangling,
which is performed by a halter</i>, it is
plain that the two evangelists do not
agree together; unless we say with
the learned Casaubon, that Judas
hanged himself, but the rope broke,
and he tumbled headlong down. But
this does not explain the manner of
his death; which saint Luke manifestly
seems to have intended; but
barely adds a circumstance of little
moment, which happen&#8217;d after it,
or at the very instant of it. Upon
the whole it is certain, that by this
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>word is not only meant <i>suffocation by
hanging</i>, but also <i>excessive grief</i>, with
which those who are violently overpowered,
frequently compass their
own death. For, as Ovid says:
<i>strangulat inclusus dolor</i>. And indeed
Perizonius has clearly proved
this point by a number of examples,
drawn from ancient authors.<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> Nor is
it less to be doubted, but that the
expression &#960;&#961;&#951;&#957;&#8052;&#962; &#947;&#949;&#957;&#8057;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;, may be used
for one, who <i>voluntarily throws himself
headlong down</i>, as well as for one,
<i>who falls headlong by some accident</i>:
which he has amply demonstrated.</p>

<p>This controversy cost more than
one dissertation. But after seriously
considering the strength of the arguments
produced by both parties; I
am of opinion, that the words of
saint Matthew may be reconciled with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>the account given by saint Luke from
saint Peter&#8217;s speech, in this manner.
When that most unhappy traitor saw
that Christ was condemned to death,
he began to repent of his deed; and
being thereupon wreck&#8217;d with grief
and despair, or seized with the swimming
in the head (which often happens
in such cases) he fell headlong
down some precipice; or, which is
more probable, he designedly threw
himself down, and his body chancing
to pitch on some large stone or stump
of a tree, his bowels burst forth, and
he was killed. Wherefore Matthew
declared his tortures of mind, which
made him destroy himself; but Luke
has clearly and properly determined
the manner of his death. Thus this
kind of death ought, with good reason,
to find a place in the list of diseases,
upon account of the real disorder

<h3><i>The disease of king Herod.</i></h3>


<p class="noindent"><span class="firstword"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> disease with which Herod
Agrippa is said to have been
smitten, by the just judgment of
God, in punishment for his pride
and of which he died, is remarkable.
For he finished his miserable life
&#963;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#951;&#954;&#8057;&#946;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962;, that is, <i>eaten by worms</i>,
as the sacred historian relates, in these
words, &#8220;Upon a set day, Herod, arrayed
in royal apparel, sat upon
his throne, and made an oration
unto them: and the people gave
a shout, saying, it is the voice of
a god, and not of a man. And
immediately the angel of the Lord
smote him, because he gave not
God the glory; and he was eaten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of worms, and gave up the<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> ghost.&#8221;
Josephus indeed, in his account of the
fact, makes no mention of worms, but
says that he was suddenly seized with
violent gripings, and after being incessantly
tortured with pains in his
bowels for five days, he expired.<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a>
But saint Luke has informed us, that
the worms, by which his bowels
were eroded, were the cause of the
gripes.</p>

<p>Now the greatest singularity in
this king&#8217;s disease is, that it was instantly
inflicted on him from heaven
(which he himself acknowledged according
to Josephus<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>) otherwise as to
verminose putrefaction in human bodies,
we have several instances of it.
For this very king&#8217;s grandfather, Herod,
surnamed the Great, is said to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>have labour&#8217;d under this disease a long
time, till at length it threw him into
a decay, of which he died.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> Likewise
Herodotus relates of Pheretima,
the mother of Arcesilaus, king of Cyrene,
that she was rotted alive by
worms.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> And it is recorded of the
Roman emperor Galerius Maximianus,
that this same loathsome disease
not only eat away his genital members,
but put an end to his life.<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a>
Wherefore it was impossible, but
that some at least of the Greek physicians
must have observed some cases
of this kind. And accordingly Galen
has proposed medicines for ulcers,
&#963;&#954;&#8061;&#955;&#951;&#954;&#945;&#962; &#7956;&#967;&#959;&#957;&#964;&#945;, that is, abounding
with worms.<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> For he says, in abscesses
there are frequently found animals,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#950;&#8182;&#945;, very like those, which are
engendered from corruption.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> And
Philoxenus in Aetius says, that <i>in
the humor of Atheroma&#8217;s, he sometimes
found animals, like gnats or
little flies</i>.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In fine, Paulus Aegineta
teaches the method of getting rid of
them.<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>In so clear a case, it is needless to
collect a greater number of authorities
from the ancients, especially
since several modern physicians have
made the same observations. For
Marcellus Donatus mentions a person
of high rank, extremely fat,
whose belly was eroded and mortified
by little worms engendered in
his skin, which was excessively distended
by fat and humors; and
these worms were not unlike those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>produced in old rotten cheese.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a> The
learned Nicolaus Tulpius saw worms
very like these, issuing with the urine
out of the body of a very celebrated
physician.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> And the Ephemerides natur&aelig;
curiosorum, contain three remarkable
cases of this kind. The
first is that of a certain Frenchman,
whose blood was so corrupted, that
very minute animals came forth day
and night with horrid tortures, thro&#8217;
most of the outlets of the skin, as
the eyes, nose, mouth, and bladder;
and at length put an end to his miserable
life.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> In the second, black
worms, not unlike scarab&aelig;i or beetles,
came out of an abscess formed
in the calf of the leg of a girl.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a>
And in the third it is said, that very
small white worms issued with the
milk from the breasts of a woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>in childbed.<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Nor can I omit two
similar cases, one of which is related
by Poterius, the other by his commentator
Frideric Hoffman. The
former attended a countryman, for a
tumor on his right knee, out of
which, when opened, little live
worms issued, which caused an intolerable
pain in the part by their
bitings. And the latter saw a tradesman,
who had a hard tumor about
the veins of the arms, which was
very troublesome to him. This was
opened by a surgeon several times
without any benefit; until an ulcer
was formed, out of which he took a
great number of little black worms,
armed with stings or prickles.<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a></p>

<p>Now these histories, wonderful as
they seem, are not to be refused credit.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>For all nature is animated in a
surprizing degree. The air which
we breathe, the food which we eat;
all fluids especially, are full of animalcula
of very different kinds.
Whence it is possible, that some of
these, being received into our bodies,
and conveyed into the minute
passages of the softest parts, as into
nests, may there grow, as worms do
in the intestines, to their proper size.
Hence by the obstruction of the smallest
vessels, tumors arise; which being
suppurated by heat, and bursting,
pour forth their foul offspring
in the shape of worms.</p>

<p>Wherefore I cannot agree with
those interpreters, who imagine that
Herod was consumed by, and died
of the <i>phthiriasis</i>, or <i>louzy disease</i>.
For &#963;&#954;&#8061;&#955;&#951;&#958; is a different creature from
&#966;&#952;&#949;&#8054;&#961;; this corrodes the surface of the
skin, that the inner parts of the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
Nor can it admit of doubt, that saint
Luke, who was a physician, well
understood the meaning of both the
words. And yet I know that the
disease proceeding &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#966;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#969;&#957; is by
some learned men confounded with
that caused &#8017;&#960;&#8056; &#964;&#8182;&#957; &#963;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#8053;&#954;&#969;&#957;; of the
first of which Pherecides Syrius,<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> and
Lucius Sylla,<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> are said to have died.
Whereupon Kuhnius says,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a> <i>I look upon
the word</i> &#963;&#954;&#969;&#955;&#951;&#954;&#8057;&#946;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; <i>in saint Luke,
and</i> &#966;&#952;&#949;&#953;&#961;&#8057;&#946;&#961;&#969;&#964;&#959;&#962; <i>in Hesychius</i>,<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> <i>to be synonimous
terms</i>: and his reason is,
because lice are worms.</p>
